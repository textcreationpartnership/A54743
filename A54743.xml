            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>NEver any Chri≈øtian Prince merited of Hi≈øtory more ≈øolid, ≈øerious, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øal Prai≈øe than <hi>Lewis</hi> the 9th

The Hereticks of latter times haply offended at the Rea≈øon he gave for refu≈øing to go to ≈øee the Body of Chri≈øt become vi≈øible in the hands of a Prie≈øt, namely, that he had no need of ocular Te≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to convince him of a Truth, whereof he was already ≈øo well ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, have with that prejudice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented even the mo≈øt Heroick of his actions, that, were their Credit valuable, this Prince could certainly be allow'd no better a Character than any of the nine la≈øt Kings of the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rovingian</hi> Race; They will needs have that haughtine≈øs wherewith he treated his Brother <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> who after he was crown'd King
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:36383:5"/>of <hi>Naples</hi> and <hi>Sicily</hi> let loo≈øe the Reins to licence, pa≈øs for an Effect of ≈øecret Pride and Ambition; they brand with ra≈øhne≈øs and imprudence the two Expeditions he made again≈øt the Infidels, and will have the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Charge he was at in tho≈øe Undertakings, no other than Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øene≈øs and Prodigality. That Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øtick Air which he expre≈øt in all his Actions, and which de≈øcended to him from the Queen his Mother, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpret to be only a natural Surli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and Au≈øterity of humour in him: and though more Covertly, they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear not to cen≈øure his frequent Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitations, and regulations of Ho≈øpitals The plainne≈øs of his habit they attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute to a poorne≈øs of Spirit in him, and from his aptne≈øs to conceal and pa≈øs over all private Injuries offer'd him, they are ready to accu≈øe him of Pu≈øillanimity and Cowardice. His Conver≈øation though obliging e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, they account too Re≈øerv'd
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:36383:6"/>and Moro≈øe, con≈øidering the Famili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arity and Freedom that had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd to Courtiers in tho≈øe times.</p>
            <p>They cavil at the ≈øincerity of his An≈øwers both by word of mouth and in writing to foreign Amba≈ø≈øadors, in the Affairs he had to concert with the Crowns of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> they tax him of too much Severity in the Execution of his Laws, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, again≈øt the Jews, and of too much adhering to particular Ju≈øtice to the prejudice of the publick in the renuntiations he made to the Dutchy of <hi>Guien</hi> and Kingdom of <hi>Ca≈øtile.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Nor is this noble Prince and Saint King <hi>Lewis</hi> better dealt with by the Catholick Hi≈øtorians, though perhaps not with ≈øuch an apparent and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign'd prejudice, and that by Rea≈øon (for a more probable cau≈øe cannot be gue≈øs'd at) of that pragmatick Sanction which came forth under the Name of this Prince, occa≈øion'd by the quarrel he had with the Court of
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:36383:6"/>
               <hi>Rome.</hi> They look'd upon as Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal the zealous Concerns he had for the Rights of his Crown, and upon this pretence took upon them to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpatter all his actions without Limit or Di≈øtinction.</p>
            <p>Of this la≈øt ≈øort of Writers ≈øome there are, who not daring to launch out into tho≈øe high Intemperancies, have yet fallen into another default equally di≈øadvantageous to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Royal Saint.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:36383:7"/>making him a great King as he was they ≈øet him forth a very Monk of the mo≈øt reformed Order. In≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much that in a Manu≈øcript Imbelli≈øht with curious Figures in Miniature which came to light about 12 years after his death, he is pourtray'd in ≈øeveral Exerci≈øes of Penitence, the mo≈øt ≈øevere and bloody that were than practic'd in Cloi≈øters. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, one <hi>Richard</hi> a Monk of the <hi>Abby</hi> of <hi>Enove de Votsge,</hi> de≈øcribes him yielding to the Temptation of a certain <hi>Jacobin</hi> who urg'd him to take upon him the Order of St. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minick,</hi> and from which nothing but the powerful and ince≈ø≈øant Interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øings of the Queen his Mother, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the <hi>Hardy</hi> his Son, and <hi>Charles</hi> of <hi>Anjou</hi> his Brother could have di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted him. <hi>Mathew Paris</hi> an Engli≈øh Benedictin, an Hi≈øtorian o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwi≈øe the mo≈øt faithful and be≈øt informed of his Time, brings in our Princely St. <hi>Lewis</hi> at his re≈øtitution
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:36383:7"/>of <hi>Guien</hi> to the Engli≈øh, uttering him≈øelf in a Speech no le≈øs void of Sen≈øe then Regal Authority, and gives him a very lame at lea≈øt impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Character, when he tells us that without fear or re≈øpect of the Barons of his Realm he had given up to the Engli≈øh, tho≈øe other Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>August</hi> his Grandfather, had alienated from them in the Reign of King <hi>John,</hi> and reunited to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi>

            <p>There were at that time in <hi>France</hi> ≈øcarce fewer Malecontents than Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and though Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> could have no lawful cau≈øe for putting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf at the Head of them, yet never could he have had a fairer and more plau≈øible pretext: He had yet neither Place of Tru≈øt nor Profit, neither Government of Town nor Province; all he had to ≈øub≈øi≈øt upon was an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different ≈øumme of Money which he receiv'd yearly out of <hi>Spain.</hi> He could not hope to make his Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion better while he kept him≈øelf in the Limits of due Obedience, whereas had he Headed the Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, he might have a≈ø≈øur'd him≈øelf of obtaining by Articles of Accomo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation what≈øoever he could have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øir'd, for ≈øince tho≈øe People would never have been reduc'd without

But of the worldly Ble≈ø≈øings that attended Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> there was none he made greater account of, or took higher Satisfaction in, than the Wife which God in his mo≈øt e≈øpecial Providence be≈øtow'd upon him, <hi>viz. Blanch</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the Daughter of <hi>Alphon≈øo</hi> King of <hi>Ca≈øtile,</hi> Sirnamed the Noble, a Prince≈øs who in that rude, heavy Age wherein ≈øhe had the Misfortune

And as none dur≈øt di≈øpute the Prerogative of beauty with her, ≈øo it was ab≈øolutely taken for confe≈øs'd on all hands that ≈øhe infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely ≈øurpa≈øs'd them in a Noble and Gallant Meen. The young Age where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ≈øhe was E≈øpous'd to <hi>Lewis,</hi> for ≈øhe was then ≈øcarce ripe for Marriage, render'd her ≈øo much the more pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and flexible in conforming to the humours and manners of the French Nation; wherein ≈øhe made ≈øo perfect an Improvement that ≈øhe could not po≈ø≈øibly have been di≈øtingui≈øh'd from a French Woman, but for that grave Severity which was too Natural to be ea≈øily quitted by her, though at a time when ≈øhe mo≈øt re≈øign'd her ≈øelf up to Complai≈øance and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity, Her Air as Maje≈øtick as it was, had yet never any thing in it of di≈øobliging, being ever attended
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:36383:15"/>with words and actions full of Spirit and Vivacity, and a Gaiety of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour that infinitely became her: She enjoy'd ≈øo vigorous a health of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy that till that ≈øickne≈øs took her which ended her dayes, ≈øhe never was troubled with any other di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per than a ≈øhort quotidian Ague, which argued rather a ≈øtrong Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution then any Intemperature of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. Her beauty was not impair'd by Age, nor did the bringing of ten Children into the World any thing dimini≈øh the fre≈øhne≈øs or delicacy of her Complexion. But that which ≈øingularly recommends her above all that hath been ≈øaid is the clear judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and exalted wit which ≈øo quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her for bu≈øine≈øs, that ≈øhe came not ≈øhort of the mo≈øt eminent Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of <hi>Spain,</hi> either for quick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øight, or prudent foreca≈øt in the weightie≈øt Affairs without the lea≈øt of that heavy ≈ølowne≈øs and irre≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which hath been the fault of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,

Her Piety was neither ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtitious, nor a Cloak for the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on of any Intere≈øt, and it was an excellent ≈øaying of hers to her Children when ≈øhe had their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion under her Care; That ≈øhe had rather ≈øee them buried than to aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don that purity of Life to which their Bapti≈øm had call'd them. Her Cha≈øtity was inviolable, however, that of all the re≈øt of her Virtues was mo≈øt di≈øputed, both during her Life and after her death. The wor≈øt that hath been ≈øaid of her in any of the mo≈øt Satyrical Pieces that have toucht her in this tender point is, that ≈øhe gave too much pretence to Calumny. She entertain'd indeed a
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:36383:16"/>Principle more dangerous than could well con≈øi≈øt with a Ladies Honour, that is to ≈øay, that there are certain junctures which though rarely, might at ≈øome time or other happen, in which Ladies might lay a≈øide the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Formalities of Honour, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they took care to pre≈øerve it inviolable in the Main. This I ≈øay, Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> held for a Fundamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Maxim of her Politicks, for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, that ≈øhe might without ≈øcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Con≈øcience endeavour to give Love to any Prince or Potentate that could not by any other means be gain'd to her Intere≈øt; e≈øpecially, when it might prove a means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or put an end to a War or any inte≈øtine broil, to make an Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment whereof too many occa≈øions will offer them≈øelves in the Sequel of this Hi≈øtory; But in the fir≈øt place, Fora≈ømuch as the Sentiments of the Queen in this matter were no way prejudicial to the Education of St.

            <p>She undertook her ≈øelf the Office of Nur≈øe to this dear Son of hers, not thinking it ≈øafe, (for where mo≈øt Love is, there is mo≈øt jealou≈øie and ≈øu≈øpicion) he ≈øhould ≈øuck of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Milk than her own, upon this there hapned a <hi>Rencountre,</hi> which being not el≈øewhere to be found, though perhaps purpo≈øely omitted as beneath the Gravity of Hi≈øtory, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hand≈øomly be here pa≈øs'd by. One day when ≈øhe had a violent hot fit of an Ague upon her, which al≈øo la≈øted longer than Ordinary, a Lady of Quality who either to plea≈øe her Maje≈øty, or in imitation of her, had taken upon her to nur≈øe her own Son, being then pre≈øent, and ≈øeeing the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Infant cry for the Teat, took up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her the boldne≈øs to give him the Brea≈øt, the Queen when the fit was over, call'd for her Child, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd

The Rea≈øon was ea≈øie to be gue≈øs'd, and the Queen her ≈øelf ≈øu≈øpected what had hapned; She pretended an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient de≈øire of returning her thanks to the per≈øon who had oblig'd her by being ≈øo kind to her Child, during her Indi≈øpo≈øition; The Lady here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon expecting no doubt to be a Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite, own'd what ≈øhe had done, and told the Queen that the crying of the Infant ≈øo ≈øen≈øibly touch'd her, that ≈øhe could not forbear to give it what Relief was in her power. But the Queen, in≈øtead of returning her the thanks ≈øhe expected, ca≈øt a mo≈øt di≈ødainful look upon her, and thru≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ≈øinger into his mouth, forc'd him to give up all he hadreceiv'd
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:36383:17"/>from her Brea≈øt. This violent Carriage of the Queen gave ≈øurpri≈øe to all that beheld it, whereupon, not to hold them long in ≈øu≈øpence, the Queen told them they ought not to think ≈øtrange of what they had ≈øeen, for that ≈øhe could not po≈ø≈øibly endure that any Woman alive ≈øhould have a Right to di≈øpute with her the Quality of a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ≈øo ≈øtedfa≈øt her per≈øwa≈øion was that the nur≈øing of Children is a great part of their Education.</p>

<pb n="30" facs="tcp:36383:20"/>and either to keep them from growing out of date, as it generally happens when the Novelty of a thing is over, or, that their Memory of them might ≈øurvive both the Author and the Prince≈øs for whom they were made, he had them grav'd in Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and expos'd to the ≈øight of the whole world in the Galleries of his Palaces at <hi>Troye</hi> and <hi>Provence,</hi> as if he were afraid lea≈øt future Ages ≈øhould be unacquainted with his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, or the time he liv'd in ≈øhould want a fit Subject for <hi>Satyre.</hi> Such was the exce≈ø≈øive heighth of his Imprudence, which the King was not then in a Condition to cha≈øti≈øe, he thought it better to pretend Ignorance, than to manife≈øt his weakne≈øs by unprofitable marks of Anger. The Engli≈øh were then in Arms for the recovery of tho≈øe French Provinces which <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> had taken from them, and <hi>France</hi> could not have hindred, had the Forces which were rais'd to

Thus was the King con≈øtrain'd to carry him≈øelf toward his Rival, as Criminal as he was, and the Event prov'd that his Maje≈øty had taken, if not the mo≈øt honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet at lea≈øt the mo≈øt profitable Expedient. The Earl, who was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon ≈øufficiently Valiant, had brought a con≈øiderable Addition to the French Army, of choice Troops, all con≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his own Va≈ø≈øals, and fought like a true Lover of that Age, that is to ≈øay, he had the Vanity to expo≈øe him≈øelf to the greate≈øt of dangers for the Love of his Lady; The Engli≈øh whom he was the forwarde≈øt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taque, were driven to ≈øtand upon their de≈øence; and the Towns of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ort,</hi> and St. <hi>John d'Angeli,</hi> which they had lately recover'd, were again ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from them by force; the Town
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:36383:21"/>of <hi>Rochel,</hi> to avoid plundering, ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the French; ≈øo that at la≈øt the Engli≈øh, di≈øheartned by ≈øo many misfortunes, were glad of a Truce. The King was the more willing to agree to it, as de≈øirous to lo≈øe no oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion for the reuniting to his Realm the large≈øt of tho≈øe Provinces which had been di≈ø≈øever'd from it ever ≈øince the declining of the ≈øecond Race.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Simon</hi> Earl of <hi>Monfort</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt and mo≈øt fortunate Captain of his Age, had gain'd <hi>Languedoc</hi> from ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral petty <hi>Albigen≈øian</hi> Princes, who at that time had po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd it; but <hi>Amaureus</hi> his Son could not keep it, the <hi>Albigen≈øes</hi> recover'd again the be≈øt part of it, and <hi>Amaureus</hi> cho≈øe rather to give up the re≈øt for the Con≈øtable's Staff of <hi>France,</hi> than to ≈øtand out till he was depriv'd of all without any Recompence. He had yielded up his Right to the mo≈øt Chri≈øtian King, and his Maje≈øty being engag'd in this War, as well for his own proper In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt,
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:36383:21"/>as tho≈øe of Religion, had a Rendezvous in <hi>Berry</hi> of all the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he could bring together, as well his own as tho≈øe of his Feudataries, with which he ≈øate down before the Town of <hi>Avignon,</hi> where the <hi>Albigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes</hi> after they were forc'd to quit the Field, had brought the choice of all their Troops.</p>
            <p>There was no want in the Town either of Provi≈øion, or any warlike Accomodations which were then in u≈øe, nor were the French without In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence thereof, yet they de≈øi≈øted not from attacquing the place, but by Rea≈øon of the death of the famous <hi>Guy</hi> Earl of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> to whom they had been oblig'd for the victory of <hi>Bovines,</hi> and of the wounding of 4000 of their men, be≈øides, 2000 more ≈ølain in the ditches, they were forc'd to change the Siege into a <hi>Blockade.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Be≈øieged for all this were ≈øoon brought to a Capitulation, and the King found therein the Keys of all
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:36383:22"/>the <hi>Albigen≈øian</hi> Towns, except tho≈øe of <hi>Tholou≈øe;</hi> the Year was too far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd and the Souldiers too much tir'd to begin a new Siege: Be≈øides, it was impo≈ø≈øible the French Caval<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry could ≈øub≈øi≈øt about <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the <hi>Albigen≈øes</hi> had plough'd all the Meadows thereabout. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it was thought expedient not to lye at too great a di≈øtance from the place, for two ≈øeveral Rea≈øons, the one, to hinder the Spaniards from drawing together tho≈øe ≈øuccours which they had promis'd to the <hi>Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen≈øes,</hi> the other, becau≈øe the French Army con≈øi≈øting chiefly of tho≈øe Troops which the Feudataries of the Crown had levied, had they been ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd to march home; the Spring and the be≈øt part of Summer (≈øo tardy mu≈øt their return have been by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the length of the way) would have been gone before, they could have turn'd to the Siege of <hi>Tholou≈øe.</hi> Upon this account it was that the
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:36383:22"/>King re≈øolv'd to take up his Winter Quarters in the Neighbouring Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces to <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and had his Head-quarters at <hi>Mont</hi>‚Äî a Ca≈øtle ≈øcituate upon the Frontiers of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vergne.</hi> The de≈øign was new, there had ≈øcarce been any Example thereof, ≈øince the Reign of the third Race in <hi>France,</hi> however, it might have been the occa≈øion of ≈øhrew'd Inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the Feudataries had infallibly oppos'd it, ≈øhould the King have gone about to put it in execution, without having fir≈øt obtain'd their con≈øent in a Council of War.</p>
            <p>It was in a full Council that the King di≈øcours'd them concerning this Affair, but in ≈øuch Terms as on the one ≈øide repre≈øented how ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary it was for the whole Army to quarter in tho≈øe places, on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øide, te≈øtified the high Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he ≈øhould take in gaining their Con≈øents, he wanted but little of his de≈øire, all the Feudataries gave their

He thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf ≈øure of ≈øeeing her within a very ≈øhort time. And you may well ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine how it would reli≈øh with the mo≈øt impatient of all men living, to meet with a fre≈øh <hi>Rencountre,</hi> that ≈øhould debar him the ≈øight of his Mi≈øtre≈øs a whole Year longer. Thus netled therefore as he was, I am not ≈øaid he, in a full Council, again≈øt the Complai≈øance of the re≈øt of the <hi>Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dataries,</hi> but for my own part, I think it ju≈øt, to ≈øtand ≈øo far upon my Rights and Priviledges, as to draw off my Troops into <hi>Brie.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This An≈øwer ≈øeem'd to proceed from nothing but a haughty, proud Re≈øolution, but the King was not ≈øo ≈ølow of apprehen≈øion as not to pierce into the true Rea≈øon. His Maje≈øty had ju≈øt cau≈øe enough of anger again≈øt him upon ≈øuch an occa≈øion, as had the
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:36383:23"/>re≈øt follow'd his Example, might have prov'd of fatal Con≈øequence, and left him abandon'd of all; nor could he refrain from reproaching the Earl for this Affront, and threatning him, if he per≈øi≈øted longer in the≈øe Expre≈ø≈øions, to fall into his Territories with Fire and Sword. The Earl who hated the King no le≈øs than he lov'd the Queen, pretended that his Maje≈øty ought to have ≈øhew'd ≈øome kind of re≈øpect toward him, and have treated him rather as an Equal, than as a Va≈ø≈øal, ≈øince he was Heir to a Crown; that he ought to take notice of tho≈øe Menaces as ≈øerious, and not words of Cour≈øe, con≈øidering what extremity the Kings ob≈øtinate humour had tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øported him to, he being too exact an ob≈øerver of his word in ≈øuch Ca≈øes. It was indeed above an Age ≈øince <hi>Brie</hi> and <hi>Champaign</hi> had been ab≈øolutely free from all the Calamities of War, and ≈øuch was the plenty in general of the whole Country, that the French
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:36383:24"/>Army might have found very good Quarters there, had it ≈øtood with the Intere≈øt of the Kings Affairs. This Crime was the mo≈øt hainous of any the Earl had been yet tax'd with, but it will appear by what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ≈øaid, that he was no Novice in committing the blacke≈øt of Enormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. Moreover, his imagination a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitated by the different pa≈ø≈øions which had got the Ma≈øtery of him, began to entertain an Idea of Parri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide as of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity at this time.</p>
            <p>He could not re≈øolve upon at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting the Kings Life by open force, at a time when he had all his Troops about him, nor was the way of A≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øination much more ≈øafe; It was now many Ages ≈øince any of the French Monarchs had been taken off by this way, ≈øo ready the Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty had been to take part with them, and to revenge all de≈øigns what≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver put in practice again≈øt. them.</p>
            <pb n="39" facs="tcp:36383:24"/>
            <p>No way was left but poi≈øon, and the French, who from the very fir≈øt beginning of the Monarchy, had had this practice in the greate≈øt dete≈øtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, began in≈øen≈øibly to have an incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to it, whether it were that they were of late grown more Ingenious in Malice, or that they had learn'd this way of giving their Enemies a di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch, either from the Infidels again≈øt whom they had born Arms, or from the Greeks with whom they had of late been more than formerly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øant. What kind of poi≈øon it was that the Earl gave the King was never ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolutely di≈øcovered, but ≈øure enough, for the greater Secrecy of the matter, ≈øuch a Do≈øe was given him as caus'd a lingring di≈øtemper. The King di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembled for many dayes the violence of the Feavour which inwardly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fum'd him, nor did he to the very la≈øt ≈øo much re≈øent the pain he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dur'd, as the di≈øturbances likely to en≈øue as to publick Affairs; Jealou≈øy
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:36383:25"/>for its greater Satisfaction finds out peculiar wayes of taking Vengeance. The Earl had the plea≈øure before he parted to ≈øee the King langui≈øhing on his death bed, and to fore≈øee that his leaving him in that Condition would augment his grief and vexati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Spirit. However, he had the confidence for all this to go and wait upon the Queen, as pre≈øuppo≈øing that ≈øhe could hardly ≈øu≈øpect the true cau≈øe of her Husbands Malady; or at lea≈øt, if ≈øhe ≈øhould come to under-it, ≈øhe would be oblig'd to conceal her knowledge, becau≈øe of the need ≈øhe would have of his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance in obtaining the Regency; Nor was it long e're the King finding his end to draw near, made his Will, in which he appointed the Queen to be Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne≈øs of her Elde≈øt Son, and Regent of the Kingdom. He dyed the≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>November,</hi> 1226, in the 39th. Year of his Age, This la≈øt Will and Te≈øtament met with no oppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:36383:26"/>prevent what ever de≈øigns might hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to be broach'd in <hi>France,</hi> was to carry with all ≈øpeed her Elde≈øt Son St. <hi>Lewis</hi> to <hi>Reims,</hi> to be there anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed King; and that nothing would ≈øo much conduce as this Ceremony to keep within the bounds of their Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance a People, prepo≈ø≈øe≈øs'd with an opinion of his being hereby made a partaker in the Sovereign Power. The extraordinary ha≈øte that was made for the King's Journy into <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,</hi> hinder'd the Grandees and Nobles from accompanying the King with the Splendor and Magnificence u≈øual upon ≈øuch occa≈øions, notice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly was given, that the King was wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to di≈øpence with the trouble and charge of tho≈øe great preparations, expecting their Attendance in per≈øon only without any pompous Train, or numerous Retinue, which in ≈øuch an Affair as this would be but trouble-≈øome and apt to breed di≈øturbance. This Ceremony was perform'd in the

This Prince found not that return of Love from the Queen which he thought his Services merit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, nor was he very much ≈øurpris'd thereat, whether it were that he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted the Queens In≈øen≈øibility to tho≈øe impre≈ø≈øions which the ≈øurviving Love of her deceas'd Husband had left in her heart, or that he believ'd the ca≈øe of her Honour oblig'd her to keep within the bounds of exact
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:36383:30"/>decorum, at a time when ≈øhe knew the Eyes of the whole world would be upon her: but he was more throughly convinc'd of the vanity of per≈øi≈øting in his Love, when he ≈øaw that the Queen, after ≈øhe had taken upon her the Regency, treated him no otherwi≈øe than common Civility oblig'd her to, and that ≈øhe neglect-him ≈øo far as not to make him a ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer in the Government by giving him a place in the Council of State: his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient humour ≈øtirr'd him up to high complaints of her ≈ølighting U≈øage. Whereupon the Earl of <hi>Bologne</hi> who was neither ignorant of his Amours, nor his ill ≈øucce≈øs therein, concluded the be≈øt way to draw him to a Revolt, would be to heighten his jealou≈øie.</p>
            <p>The Pope had ≈øent <hi>Legate</hi> into <hi>France,</hi> a Prelate altogether agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to that Court: he was call'd <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manor,</hi> being a Native of <hi>Rome</hi> of the lowe≈øt rank of the Populacy; neverthele≈øs, he was endu'd with ≈øuch
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:36383:30"/>qualities as made him appear a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of real Grandure in all places wherever he came: he had an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ≈øhape of body, and for a gallant Meen was not equall'd by any; his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and quick parts made him pa≈øs for a Miracle of wit, and the rather for that it was very rare in that Age. In fine, all <hi>Europe</hi> could not boa≈øt ≈øo compleat a Courtier: to him <hi>France</hi> ow'd the Conque≈øts that had been made in <hi>Languedock;</hi> for it was he that call'd the Council at <hi>Bourges,</hi> wherein the continuation of the war again≈øt the <hi>Albigen≈øes</hi> was decreed; he that had di≈øpos'd all the Nobility of the Realm to ≈øerve in this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition at their own Charge; he that had excommunicated anew the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe;</hi> he that took off the Fathers of the Councel from ≈øhewing him any favour, when he came in as a penitent at a time when they lea≈øt expected it. This induc'd the Queen to have a particular re≈øpect
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:36383:31"/>for the Legate, whether mov'd by the meer con≈øideration of his Merits, or thinking her ≈øelf oblig'd to treat with more than ordinary Civilities a Mini≈øter of the Court of <hi>Rome,</hi> and one who≈øe a≈ø≈øi≈øtance ≈øhe mainly ≈øtood in need of to compleat the Conque≈øt of <hi>Languedock,</hi> and to keep the <hi>French</hi> in ≈øubjection and obedience during ≈øo long a Mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; She con≈øulted him in all impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant affairs, follow'd his advice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all others, and of tho≈øe pa≈ø≈øant Civilities he de≈øir'd for any of his friends ≈øhe deny'd him none; the≈øe things added ≈øo much to the count of <hi>Champaign</hi>'s jealou≈øie, that the Malecontents could have wi≈øht for no better opportunity to bring him over to their Party.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi> repre≈øented to him that he ought in rea≈øon to di≈øengage his heart from a Spani≈øh woman, who had been ≈øo lavi≈øh of hers as to part with it to a Prie≈øt,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:36383:31"/>and that he could not in honour have any other Sentiments for her, than tho≈øe of abhorrence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, for the injury ≈øhe did to the Memory of her deceas'd Husband. There is nothing a man inclines to. more than to believe things areas he would have them.</p>
            <p>The Earl how ever was at a lo≈øs, and knew not what to think of her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of treating him; he could not imagine that ≈øo young and fair as ≈øhe was, ≈øhe could confine her ≈øelf all her life long to a langui≈øhing and di≈øcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolate Widow-hood, having an over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which ≈øhe might be glad to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace, of enjoying in ≈øecond Nupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als the Heir pre≈øumptive of the Crown of <hi>Navarre;</hi> ail this while he ≈øaw plainly that this Prince≈øs had no di≈øpo≈øition to make him happy, though to her own advantage; and ≈øince he could not dive into the true cau≈øe, and was not ≈øatisfied with any of tho≈øe he revolved in his mind; he
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:36383:32"/>fix'd upon that which had been ≈øug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øted to him, never examining the probability of it, or con≈øidering that it was infinitely more ridiculous than any thing he could imagine be≈øide.</p>
            <p>Thus imputing the Queens indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference for him, to the love which it was ≈øurmi≈øed ≈øhe had for the Legate; upon this ≈øullen ≈øuppo≈øition he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolv'd upon the ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing of a pa≈ø≈øion, with which he was even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to bur≈øt. Upon this he entred into the Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi>'s Party, and drew along with him his Brother of Arms, <hi>Hugo de Dampmartin,</hi> Count of <hi>Ponthieu,</hi> who≈øe Elde≈øt Brother was <hi>Renald,</hi> Count of <hi>Dampmartin, Au≈øcon, I≈ølebon,</hi> and <hi>Domfront.</hi> He having married the Niece of King <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>August,</hi> took the boldne≈øs and Authority upon him, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of this Alliance to be≈øiege, and having taken it, to ra≈øe down to the ground a Ca≈øtle belonging to the Bi≈øhop of <hi>Beauvais,</hi> a Prince of the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:36383:32"/>blood, and Cou≈øin German to the ≈øaid <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>August,</hi> who, glad of an occa≈øion to bring down this Count of <hi>Dampmartin,</hi> whom he knew to be the mo≈øt turbulent and dangerous per≈øon of his whole Realm, took ≈øpeedy cour≈øe with him, and confi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated all his E≈øtate. The Earl thus reduc'd from his former heighth to a dependance upon others for mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, was forc'd at la≈øt to beg the Kings pardon, but in vain; for all the An≈øwer he could obtain of the King was, that though he had no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to give an account of his actions to any one what≈øoever, yet neverthele≈øs, he was content to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the hearing of all matters in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trover≈øie to the Chamber Royal, and the Barons of the Realm.</p>
            <p>But this propo≈øal reli≈øh'd not at all with the Earl, for be≈øides that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected no other than to be condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, if they ≈øhould proceed to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt rigour again≈øt him; he knew
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:36383:33"/>well enough the power and credit his Maje≈øty had in that Court where he was to plead. So that ≈øeeing no other remedy, he took part with the Engli≈øh, and had the misfortune to be taken with other Pri≈øoners at the Battel of <hi>Bovines,</hi> where he had lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh'd out a long Confinement, though in a ≈øpatious Pri≈øon, of about 22 Years, his Brother the Earl of <hi>Ponthieu</hi> not being able to procure his Relea≈øement. And indeed the two la≈øt Kings, <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th. and after them the Regent, had ever held it as a ≈øure Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical Maxim, that it very much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to keep in durance all his life time, that Va≈ø≈øal of theirs who was mo≈øt potent and formidable, ≈øo long as there was any advantage to he taken without any ab≈øolute viola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Ju≈øtice; ≈øo that there was no probability of this Earls deliverance but by force of Arms. The Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi> promis'd <hi>Ponthieu</hi> to act
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:36383:33"/>with all the vigour requi≈øite upon ≈øuch an occa≈øion for the ≈øetting his Brother free; and that if it were not done before the Overtures of a Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace, the ≈øaid Treaty ≈øhould never be concluded but upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition he were fir≈øt releas'd</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi> being thus a≈ø≈øur'd of tho≈øe Feudataries who were neare≈øt about the heart of the French Monarchy, made it his next de≈øign to gain tho≈øe who were more remote, and more e≈øpecially addre≈øs'd him≈øelf to <hi>Jane</hi> Counte≈øs of <hi>Flanders,</hi> and <hi>Hainault.</hi> This Prince≈øs was married to <hi>Ferdinand</hi> Infant of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal,</hi> and Elde≈øt Son of King <hi>Sanchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> who according to the Cu≈øtome of the <hi>Cadets</hi> of noble Families, had ≈øought his Fortune in <hi>France,</hi> and behav'd him≈øelf like one of tho≈øe old Knights errant ≈øo renown'd in Story; and in truth he lighted upon better fortune than ever he could have hop'd for. <hi>Balduin</hi> Emperor of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:36383:34"/>
               <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> dying without I≈ø≈øue Male, had left King <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gu≈øt</hi> Tutor to his daughter Prince≈øs <hi>Jane,</hi> with power to marry her to whom he thought fit. The King having a good opinion of <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi>'s Merit; or, el≈øe not willing to be≈øtow her upon a French man, for fear of making him too potent, match'd her to this Portugue≈øs, who had not made his preten≈øion to her, but as re≈øolving to ≈øtand in Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition with any pretenders what≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, though their hopes were built upon never ≈øo much better a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation. But no ≈øooner was <hi>Ferdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nand</hi> by this Match become Ma≈øter of two E≈øtates, more con≈øiderable at that time than the Crown of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> it ≈øelf, but he ≈øtain'd his Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by a mo≈øt horrible Ingratitude. He ≈øuffer'd him≈øelf to be deluded by the ≈øame <hi>Renald de Dampmartin,</hi> whom we have already mention'd, ≈øo far as to bear Arms for the Engli≈øh
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:36383:34"/>again≈øt his Benefactor; for which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervedly he had the ≈øame fate, being likewi≈øe taken Pri≈øoner at <hi>Bovines,</hi> after he had receiv'd ≈øix wounds in the body by the valiant <hi>Hugode Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>revil,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Xaintogne.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, his being taken Pri≈øoner, trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled him nothing near ≈øo much as the cour≈øe they took with him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards; for the King, who knew him to be the proude≈øt Prince of that Age, knew al≈øo what would mo≈øt touch him to the quick, and bring down the pride of his haughty heart; he caus'd him to be led in Triumph through the Streets of <hi>Paris,</hi> in which di≈øgraceful march he was ≈øaluted with ≈øuch kind of Language as the Mobile commonly be≈øtow upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of his Circum≈øtance. After he had been kept for ≈øome time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other hopes than of perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Impri≈øonment, it was thought fit to give him up a Freeman to the tears and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øions of his Wife,
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:36383:35"/>who was come to ca≈øt her ≈øelf at the Kings feet, and to let him live in peace, only all the ≈øtrong places of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Hainault</hi> were to be ras'd to the ground. Hereupon, he was ≈øhortly to have been releas'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Geoffry</hi> Son of the Earl of <hi>Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bant</hi> his ≈øtanding ≈øurety for him; but whether it were that <hi>Geoffry</hi> refus'd to yield to that clau≈øe of the Treaty, or, that the King had taken fre≈øh di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plea≈øure from any words <hi>Ferdinand</hi> had let fall ≈øince this Negotiation, he was ≈øtill kept a Pri≈øoner, and his Wife thus fru≈øtrated of her hopes of ≈øeeing him again at liberty, yielded to the fir≈øt invitation made to her of entring into the League; The Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi> encourag'd by this ≈øo ≈øpeedy and pro≈øperous ≈øucce≈øs, made his next Addre≈øs to two Brothers Princes of the Blood, <hi>viz. Peter</hi> Duke of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and <hi>Robert</hi> Earl of <hi>Dreux:</hi> As for the Duke of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign,</hi> he was no le≈øs oblig'd to the

            <p>Now for the better under≈øtanding of an Entreague which hath not been ≈øufficiently made known, neither in the Hi≈øtory of <hi>France,</hi> nor of any other Nation, it is to be noted, that <hi>Rollando,</hi> the fir≈øt Duke of <hi>Norman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,</hi> compell'd by force of Arms, the fir≈øt Earl of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> to do him Homage for his Earldom, in the ≈øame manner as the Dukes of <hi>Normandy</hi> have ≈øince done Homage for their Dutchies to the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> that is to ≈øay, <hi>Bretaign</hi> became an <hi>arrier-fief</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> In this State it continued till the death of <hi>Covan</hi>‚ÄîEarl of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> who left I≈ø≈øue only one daughter nam'd <hi>Con≈øtance.</hi> This rich Heire≈øs was courted by many, but <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øecond King of <hi>England</hi> pretended, as Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> the Right of

In fine, the was
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:36383:36"/>married to him upon con≈øiderations meerly Political, for his per≈øon was no way taking with the young Lady; but his death ≈øoon deliver'd her, and left her to a ≈øecond Marriage more to her content; for ≈øhe her ≈øelf then made choice of <hi>Guy de Thouars,</hi> a Knight, the hand≈øome≈øt and brave≈øt per≈øon of his Age, by whom ≈øhe had but one daughter; her fir≈øt Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band had left her big with Child of a Son nam'd <hi>Arthur,</hi> who≈øe death was the more unhappy, for that he was depriv'd thereby of ≈øuch an accumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Succe≈ø≈øions; that of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Provinces there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto appendant, fell to him by the death without I≈ø≈øue of his Fathers two Elde≈øt Brothers; and <hi>Bretaign</hi> being his at the ≈øame time in Right of his Mother, he had doubtle≈øs in pro≈øpect, had he liv'd, the va≈øte≈øt Monarchy that had been known ≈øince the partage of the Imperial Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of <hi>Charles</hi> the Great; but <hi>John</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:36383:37"/>≈øirnamed <hi>Lackland</hi> the only Uncle, who ≈øurviv'd, procur'd his death to get his E≈øtate, and by this means the daughter of <hi>Guy de Thouars,</hi> became ≈øole Heire≈øs of the Earldom of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign. Philip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> who ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantage of the villany of <hi>John Lackland,</hi> had reunited the Dutchy of <hi>Normandy</hi> to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> pretended that ≈øince <hi>Henry</hi> the≈øe cond, King of <hi>England,</hi> had power as being Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> to di≈øpo≈øe of the Mother, he both as Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> and King of <hi>France</hi> together, had ≈øo much the better Title to di≈øpo≈øe of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The branch of <hi>Dreux</hi> was at that time the mo≈øt proper branch of the Royal Family: his appennage was ≈ømall, he had neither Office nor Government, his Alliances had not enrich'd him, and it was to be fear'd he might lo≈øe his Rank for want of E≈øtate; as it hapned ≈øome time ≈øince, to the branch of <hi>Cortenai,</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:36383:37"/>his publih'd Genealogy be altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exact. This made <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> the more willing to give the Heire≈øs of <hi>Bretaign</hi> to <hi>Peter de Dreux,</hi> with this Condition, that <hi>Bretaign</hi> ≈øhould henceforth be immediately held of the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> that is to ≈øay, that it ≈øhould no more do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, to whoever ≈øhould be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of <hi>Normandy,</hi> in ca≈øe that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ≈øhould ever be again di≈ømem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred from the Crown. The Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was advantagious to both the new married Parties, ≈øince their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtates were now no longer held in <hi>arrier fiefs;</hi> nor would depend for the time to come upon a ≈øingle Duke of <hi>Normandy,</hi> but only upon the fir≈øt of Chri≈øtian Kings. Nor did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny one receive prejudice by it, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Normandy</hi> was reunited to the Crown. No wonder then if <hi>Peter de Dreux</hi> and his Wife accepted gladly the Condition, and ob≈øerv'd it in all particulars. But that ≈øoon befel the
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:36383:38"/>new Duke of <hi>Bretaign</hi> which is but too frequent with men of ≈ølender virtue, that is to ≈øay, he ≈øuffer'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to be drawn away, and tran≈øport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this flowing Tide of good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. The large Extent of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and its advantageous Situation, gave it a very ≈øufficient Title, and Merit in this Princes opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to an ab≈øolute and independent Sovereignty; be≈øides, he was pleas'd to flatter him≈øelf with this conceit that his carrying on ≈øo high a de≈øign, as the ≈øhaking of the French yoke, would immortalize his Name to all Po≈øterity: which great undertaking, the better to accompli≈øh, he was real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly per≈øwaded that his ≈øiding with the Earl of <hi>Boulogne,</hi> and his Party, was as fair an opportunity as he could have wi≈øht for, taking it for granted, that if the Earl ≈øucceeded, he could do no le≈øs than remit his homage of <hi>Bretaign</hi> in recompense of his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for him; In ca≈øe he did not ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed,
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:36383:38"/>the Regent in revenge, that ≈øhe might oblige tho≈øe Princes of the blood, who had taken part with him, to de≈øert him, would be glad to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de≈øcend to what ever they ≈øhould demand of her. Thus the Duke of <hi>Bretaign</hi> turn'd Rebel upon fal≈øe ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes, with which he fed his fancy; but the mo≈øt cro≈øs and untoward oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence in his Revolt, was his draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in upon a quite contrary princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, his Brother <hi>Robert de Dreux.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This Per≈øon had a Soul ≈øo ≈øen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of all benefits, and ≈øo prone to grateful returns, that he thought he could not better te≈øtifie the high ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation he had to the Duke of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign,</hi> for having left entire to him the Apennage of their branch, than by ≈øerving him for, or, again≈øt whom ≈øoever he de≈øir'd, except the King. Thus he put him≈øelf under the Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Malecontents, by a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive the mo≈øt excu≈øable that ever was, if any excu≈øe can be admitted in matters of Trea≈øon.</p>

            <p>The la≈øt Prince of the blood that the Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi> drew in to his Party, was <hi>Robert</hi> of <hi>Courtenay,</hi> whom he found the more pliable to his Temptations by di≈øcontent, becau≈øe, the branch of the <hi>Dreux</hi> had been preferr'd before his by the Match of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and to engage him the more deeply, he had opportunity given him to make him≈øelf Ma≈øter of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øumms of the Kings mony.</p>

               <hi>Raimond</hi> the 7th of that Name, Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> ≈øirnamed the young, was before hand with the Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, to whom without ≈øtaying for any Invitation from them, he went and joyned of his own accord, upon the fir≈øt pro≈øpect he had of a civil war.

This ≈øort of people were at that time not ≈øo numerous as the Catholicks; and ≈øhould the Regent take <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> the Capital City of that Country, there would be no po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Counts ree≈øtabli≈øhment. So that by thus engaging him≈øelf with the Malecontents, he thought on the

The Earl of <hi>Provence,</hi> a Prince e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually con≈øiderable, and his Cou≈øin of the hou≈øe of <hi>Catalogue,</hi> came in la≈øt of the French into the Earl of <hi>Bolognes</hi> Party, led by Motives which only concern'd him at a di≈øtance; for he had no rea≈øon to complain either of the mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Kings in general, or, of the Regent in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, again≈øt whom he could be no otherwi≈øe incens'd, than by tho≈øe too deep reflections he made upon what might happen for the future, the French as he thought, border'd too near upon <hi>Provence,</hi> their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood rendred them ≈øu≈øpected to him; when the French had a victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious King at the head of them, his
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:36383:40"/>fear of being entangled in his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øins Ruine kept him back from aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him again≈øt them; but after that this Warlike Prince was taken off by Death, he thought, that though he could not yet with ≈øafety pluck off his Vizard quite, and have recour≈øe to open Arms in defence of the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> who was yet but half ejected, he might at lea≈øt ≈øecurely act under-hand, ≈øo as to engage them the ≈øooner in a Civil War, which was in a manner already begun, to the end, he might give Advantage to the ≈øaid Earl to recover <hi>Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc,</hi> without being Oblig'd to any one but him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>The greate≈øt part of the Princes and Nobility of <hi>France</hi> being thus corrupted by the Artifices above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, the Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi>'s Faction was in all appearance ≈øtrong enough not to ≈øtand in need of the help of ≈øtrangers, yet neverthele≈øs it was re≈øolv'd no Aids ≈øhould be
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:36383:41"/>refus'd, of how little nece≈ø≈øity ≈øoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; as if it were not enough for <hi>France</hi> to be torn in pieces by its own Hands, but it mu≈øt al≈øo bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row tho≈øe of the mo≈øt Ancient and Formidable Enemy.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Henry</hi> the Third of <hi>England</hi> was a great Ma≈øter-piece of Fortune, that is to ≈øay, he was equally an Object of her favourS and her frowns; he had for his Father a Homicide, an Athei≈øt, a Per≈øon dethron'd, and under all Eccle≈øia≈øtical Cen≈øures, which followed him ≈øo clo≈øe he could neither get Food nor Harbour but in places and among People where he was not known: The Son had his ≈øhare in all the≈øe Calamities, but they attended him no longer than during the Life of him who had drawn them upon his own Head. God, who, when he goes about to puni≈øh Crimes, hath an Eye upon the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Actors, took pity on the Hou≈øe of <hi>England.</hi> As ≈øoon as this Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:36383:41"/>which it brought forth was cut off, Providence was particularly concern'd for <hi>Henry</hi> the Third, the Innocent Son of this ≈øo Criminal Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and ≈øettled him in the Throne of <hi>England,</hi> when there was not the lea≈øt likelyhood he ≈øhould ever a≈øcend it; and this Affair, which ≈øeem'd altogether impo≈ø≈øible by all the Intrigues of Policy, was brought to pa≈øs almo≈øt in a moment, and that without either Trouble or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øtation, or Expence or Blood.</p>
            <p>There remain'd nothing now but to recover tho≈øe Provinces of <hi>France</hi> which had been won from <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt:</hi> And <hi>Henry</hi> thought now to compa≈øs that, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ≈øtriking a ≈øtroak, which he in vain attempted by force of Arms in the Reign of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th. <hi>viz.</hi> the re-uniting tho≈øe Provinces to the Crown of <hi>England,</hi> and that by pretending to take part with the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious <hi>French,</hi> ≈øuppo≈øing the Regent
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:36383:42"/>finding it impo≈ø≈øible to oppo≈øe him, and at the ≈øame time to defend her ≈øelf from tho≈øe that went about to degrade her, would immediately up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on notice of his Landing in <hi>France</hi> with a pui≈ø≈øant Army, ≈øeek for an Accommodation, and offer him all that had been taken from the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh,</hi> on Condition he would turn tho≈øe Arms again≈øt the Rebels which he had de≈øign'd for their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. So that he had no ≈øooner receiv'd the Earl of <hi>Boulogne</hi>'s Me≈ø≈øage, which was meerly to ≈øift out of him, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no he inclin'd to concern him≈øelf in the bickerings which were beginning in <hi>France,</hi> but he rais'd a far more pui≈ø≈øant Army than any of his Predece≈ø≈øors had ever led again≈øt any of the mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Kings; moreover, under pretence of Obliging the Male-contents the more, he undertook to Command the Army in Per≈øon, and to be at all the Charges of Levying and Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øporting
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:36383:42"/>≈øporting it; but the real truth is, his going in Per≈øon was rather to hinder them from Treating with him by Writing, choo≈øing rather by his Per≈øonal pre≈øence to have an Ear open to ≈øuch Propo≈øitions as he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øum'd the Regent would ≈øoon make to him. Behold here the whole Foundation of the League concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted under the Minority of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> never was there any one ≈øo Potent, or ≈øo cunningly driven on ≈øince the e≈øtabli≈øhment of the <hi>French</hi> Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy; nor can the Abilities of Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> be any way better under≈øtood or expre≈øs'd, than by the recount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of tho≈øe Intrigues by which ≈øhe wound her ≈øelf out of the mo≈øt trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble≈øome Exigences that ever Heroick Vertue was reduc'd to, and made a ≈øhift to pre≈øerve the Crown in all its lu≈øtre for the King her Son.</p>
            <p>The Male-contents had carried their Affairs with ≈øo much precaution and Secrecy, that the Court had not
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:36383:43"/>the lea≈øt Intelligence of them, and all the ≈øu≈øpicion the Regent had, was only grounded upon two actions, ≈øubject enough to a dubious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction; the one was the great care which the Earl of <hi>Bologne</hi> took to Fortifie <hi>Calais,</hi> the Town of his Apennage, and the u≈øual place of Landing for the <hi>Engli≈øh;</hi> The other was the re-inforcement of the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons which the Duke of <hi>Bretaign</hi> had put, at the reque≈øt of the late King, into the Ca≈øtles of St. <hi>James, Beuron,</hi> and <hi>Bele≈øm.</hi> As there was ju≈øt rea≈øon to apprehend that the≈øe two Innovations happened not but upon ≈øome My≈øterious account, the Regent took an occa≈øion hereupon immediately to bethink her ≈øelf of her own ≈øafety; and not knowing as yet either the number or the quality of tho≈øe that had combin'd for her De≈øtruction, all that her Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence could ≈øugge≈øt to her, was to give Order to tho≈øe Military Officers
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:36383:43"/>who had mo≈øt eminently te≈øtified their Fidelity to her Husband, to rai≈øe what po≈ø≈øible Force they could. 'Tis hard to re≈øolve, whether it were by Choice or good hap, that mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ≈øucceeded according to her wi≈øh, but this is certain, that they acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them≈øelves like Men of Honour in the Commi≈ø≈øions ≈øhe gave them, and brought their Troops timely enough into the Field to ≈øave the State, by preventing the Earl of <hi>Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne</hi> from ≈øeizing upon his Nephew the Young King, and by an Action ≈øo ≈øea≈øonable, even to fini≈øh the War as ≈øoon as it was begun.</p>
            <p>The Earl thus fru≈øtrated of his fir≈øt De≈øign, fore-≈øaw that it would not be ≈øo ea≈øie a matter as he fir≈øt fancy'd to him≈øelf to Degrade his Si≈øter-in-Law, wherefore the better to make ≈øure of his Accomplices, he endeavour'd by all means po≈ø≈øible to make them irreconcileable with the Regent. He knew where the greate≈øt
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:36383:44"/>part of the Kings Trea≈øure was kept, and there it was that he made his ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Effort, accordingly he ≈øeiz'd on it, and di≈øtributed it to tho≈øe of his Party, with this Condition, that tho≈øe who were neare≈øt to him ≈øhould have the greate≈øt ≈øhare. This done, he led them towards <hi>Calais,</hi> there to joyn the King of <hi>England,</hi> who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the mea≈øures he had taken from the Male-contents, was to make his De≈øcent at that very time. But there is nothing ≈øo uncertain as the managing of great Enterprizes, by rea≈øon of that general concour≈øe of different Cau≈øes whereupon they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend for ≈øucce≈øs.</p>
            <p>The Regent lo≈øt neither her Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage nor her Judgment at a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture when on the one ≈øide ≈øhe had little or nothing to hope for; and on the other, very much to fear. Never was there known to come out of her Mouth either Complaint or Reproach. She knew exactly the
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:36383:44"/>bad condition of her Affairs, and u≈øed all the Art of Di≈ø≈øimulation ≈øhe was capable of to conceal what ≈øhe thought, for fear of di≈øcouraging tho≈øe faithful Per≈øons ≈øhe had remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about her. She gue≈øs'd at the Earl of <hi>Bologne</hi>'s De≈øign from the very moment he took his March, and wi≈øely gain'd her Advantage by the needle≈øs ≈øtop he made in <hi>Eureux,</hi> for the hindring of his pa≈ø≈øage. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, as ≈øhe concluded that <hi>France</hi> was in all likelyhood inevitably lo≈øt if the Male-contents ≈øhould joyn the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> ≈øhe had recour≈øe to an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifice which I cannot but ≈øtand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoni≈øh'd that no Hi≈øtorians ever yet made mention of. There was in <hi>England</hi> a Per≈øon named <hi>Hubert de Bourg,</hi> ≈øo con≈øiderable in all re≈øpects, that he was equall'd by no Man, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Favour or Merit; he had a Wit beyond the Common rate, and his ≈øhape was ≈øuch as what Poets u≈øe to attribute to <hi>Heroes.</hi> He was at
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:36383:45"/>once both the mo≈øt accompli≈øh'd Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier and the mo≈øt expert Captain of his Nation; and never was there <hi>Engli≈øh</hi>-man a truer Lover, and more Zealous Patriot of his Countrey: He ≈øerved both King and Kingdom to that degree, that both had an equal ≈øhare of Obligation to him. It was by him that the Crown had been pre≈øerv'd in the Family of the <hi>Plantagenets,</hi> and that <hi>England</hi> had not been made a Province to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> He defended to the utmo≈øt <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Guien</hi> again≈øt <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt,</hi> and had ≈øucce≈ø≈øively in the chief places of both the≈øe Provinces held out long Sieges, and by his ob≈øtinate Re≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ruined whole Armies, never yielding to come to Capitulation till ≈øuch time as the very Hor≈øes were all eaten up. Even the <hi>French</hi> his Enemies both admiring and honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him for his Valour, thought they could never enough commend him
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:36383:45"/>when they ≈øaw him here in <hi>England;</hi> and how ju≈øt their Commendations were, he ceas'd not afterwards to give them fre≈øh demon≈øtrations, ≈øince he alone it was who ≈ønatch'd out of Prince <hi>Lewis</hi> his hands the Conque≈øt of this I≈øland. He it was who by his Gallantry recovered the Town of <hi>Dover,</hi> and Defended it with that per≈øeverance, that all the <hi>French</hi> Forces ≈øent again≈øt it, were not able to re-take it. He afterwards beat them twice, once at <hi>Lincoln,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time before <hi>Bedford.</hi> In fine, he it was, who having di≈øpos'd the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> to acknowledge him, ≈øet King <hi>Henry</hi> upon his Throne.</p>
            <p>And as the Obligation of this King <hi>Henry</hi> was very great, ≈øo His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øties care and ≈øtudy to recompen≈øe him was no le≈øs; he confer'd upon him all the Principal Offices in the State, except that of High Admiral, for he was Grand Mar≈øhal, Lord High Trea≈øurer, and Chief Ju≈øticiary all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:36383:46"/>at one time. He bad the Charge of the Tran≈øportation of tho≈øe Troops which were de≈øign'd for <hi>France,</hi> which Tru≈øt while he was di≈øcharging with his ordinary care and vigilance, he received at that very juncture a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of 5000 Marks of Silver with a Letter which neatly and wittily ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied upon his Vanity, by in≈øinuating to him, that to make him≈øelf the mo≈øt Illu≈øtrious Per≈øon that ever <hi>England</hi> bore, he who had lately ≈øettled the Crown of <hi>England</hi> upon the Head of Young King <hi>Henry</hi> his Ma≈øter, maugre all the Force of <hi>France,</hi> ought now to make it his next bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs to ≈øet the Crown al≈øo upon the Head of the Young King of <hi>France,</hi> again≈øt all the united Forces both of his own Subjects, and of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The weakne≈øs of Humane Nature never di≈øcovers it ≈øelf more plainly than when in a moment it yields to le≈ø≈øer Temptations, when at other times it hath for a long while with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtood
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:36383:46"/>greater. This was the Ca≈øe of <hi>Du Bourg,</hi> who after he had been inflexible to the va≈øt Offers of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> and <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th. ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered him≈øelf at la≈øt to be overcome with a petty Pre≈øent and a poor fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volous bait of Vain glory offered him by a Foreign Prince≈øs. He Equipp'd forth but half the number of Ships nece≈ø≈øary for the Tran≈øpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Army; and when the Noblemen, who had almo≈øt all in general provided to attend the King per≈øonally in this Expedition, came to <hi>Dover</hi> to ≈øee their Goods di≈øpos'd of on board the Ships, there was not room nor Convenience found for them; nor could it be doubted but that either the Knavery or Negligence of <hi>Du Bourg</hi> was the cau≈øe, whereupon immediately Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint was carried to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Du Bourg</hi> was ≈øent for to give an account to His Maje≈øty, but when he came, he made ≈øo lame a Defence
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:36383:47"/>for him≈øelf, that the King incens'd again≈øt him, called him Old Traytor, and drawing his Sword, had certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly run him through the Body, had not the Earl of <hi>Che≈øter,</hi> an intimate Friend of <hi>Du Bourg,</hi> put by the thru≈øt, and given Opportunity to other Per≈øons intere≈øted in the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of this Favourite, to interpo≈øe in his behalf, and to avert His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties di≈øplea≈øure for the pre≈øent. In the next place, they made him keep out of the way, till ≈øuch time as they had made his Peace, which was not long; for the King, however touch'd in the mo≈øt ≈øen≈øible and incurable part, namely, that of Ambition, yet in the end ≈øuffer'd him≈øelf to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd that the old Obligations he had to this his Favourite ought to weigh with him more than the injury lately committed. He gave him his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don freely, and in ≈øome time receiv'd him into his wonted Grace and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our.</p>
            <pb n="85" facs="tcp:36383:47"/>
            <p>The Regent encourag'd with the ≈øucce≈øs of her fir≈øt Project, namely, her ob≈øtructing with ≈øo much ea≈øe the pa≈ø≈øage of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Army over into <hi>France,</hi> put in execution a ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond De≈øign, as no le≈øs bold and difficult in appearance, ≈øo al≈øo no le≈øs advantageous in ca≈øe it ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: She was not ignorant how ≈øtrong and fervent a Pa≈ø≈øion ≈øhe had rai≈øed in the Heart of the Earl of <hi>Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,</hi> and had a ≈øhrewd conjecture that the de≈øpight of ≈øeeing him≈øelf treated with ≈øo much indifference was the onely cau≈øe which induc'd him to engage with the Male-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and accept of the Supreme Command of their Army. She had moreover too good an Opinion of her Charms, not to believe ≈øhe could at any time when ≈øhe plea≈øed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excite the Earls Love, and by never ≈øo ≈ømall an expre≈ø≈øion of her Favour, call him back to his Devoir. It was now a fit time to make proof hereof,
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:36383:48"/>and the Regent re≈øolv'd to put it in agitation her own way, that is to ≈øay, with an Air wherein to appear Obliging, ≈øhe would neverthele≈øs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit nothing of her wonted re≈øerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs.</p>
            <p>The Me≈ø≈øage ≈øhe ≈øent to this doubly Revolted Lover was onely this in ≈øhort, <hi>viz. That ≈øhe ≈øhould not be ≈øorry to ≈øee him.</hi> And this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, though the ≈øhorte≈øt and ≈ølendere≈øt certainly that ever was in this kind, produc'd an effect the ≈øtrange≈øt that ever was heard of in the <hi>French</hi> Hi≈øtory in matter of Love. It ≈øuffic'd to tie the Earl more ≈øtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than ever, to the Chains of his Pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion and her Intere≈øts, and to make him forget in an in≈øtant all the Cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs ≈øhe had ever ≈øhew'd toward him; he lo≈øt that acutene≈øs of Wit which was ≈øo Natural to him, and con≈øpir'd with the Regent to deceive him≈øelf. He fancied that all of a ≈øudden ≈øhe began to have a tenderne≈øs, though
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:36383:48"/>there were all appearances imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the contrary; and this fancy of his was ≈øo ≈øtrongly rooted, that he detach'd his Troops from the Ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous of tho≈øe of the League, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pretence of going to beat up one of the Quarters of the Kings Forces, and carried them to joyn the Army which he feign'd he was going to ≈øet upon.</p>
            <p>His De≈øertion put the whole party of the Rebels into ≈øuch a di≈øturbance and confu≈øion, that all the Princes and Grandees thereof were not able to compo≈øe it. The mo≈øt expedient way by which they thought to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy it, was immediately to make choice of another General, and they had the good hap to agree unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mou≈øly upon a Per≈øon whom they judged worthy to take upon him ≈øo important a place; ≈øuch an a≈øcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent hath extraordinary Merit even upon the mo≈øt Criminal minds. They all fixt their Eyes upon <hi>Enguerrand,</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:36383:49"/>the ≈øecond of that Name, Lord of <hi>Couci,</hi> a Gentleman of <hi>Piccardy,</hi> of a Reputation too well receiv'd for any one not to ≈øubmit to receive Orders from him. His Valour ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted the common rate of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Actions, and the proofs he gave of it in the Wars of the Holy Land carried a greater ≈øemblance of Fable than of Truth, and might, though true, have better pa≈øs'd for Romance than what we read in the mo≈øt Romantick ≈øtories. He had both Conduct and Hone≈øty; and doubtle≈øs he had pre≈øerv'd the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire of <hi>Con≈øtantinople</hi> in the <hi>French</hi> Line, had they promoted his Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage with that Heire≈øs, in≈øtead of Matching her imprudently, as they did, to <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Auxerre.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For what rea≈øon he entered into the League again≈øt the Regent is not known, but certain it is he refu≈øed the Command of their Army, and that not either for want of Courage, or
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:36383:49"/>de≈øpairing of Succe≈øs. All Men are not ea≈øily carried away to all ≈øorts of Crimes; and Heroick Vertue may, like the Sun, be capable of ≈øome ≈øpots that may ob≈øcure it, but never be totally darkned, no more than this King of Stars can wholly lo≈øe its Light. <hi>Couci</hi> moreover knew the va≈øt difference between barely being of a Party in a Revolt, and being the Head or Chief of the ≈øaid Party; and his Hone≈øty became a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake, if I may ≈øo ≈øay, when it ≈øaw it ≈øelf expos'd to the mo≈øt dangerous of Civil Temptations. He never throughly fore-≈øaw the Con≈øequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of his Engagment till he was ju≈øt upon the Precipice; that is to ≈øay, till he found that the Charge which the Confederates would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd upon him was de≈øign'd to ≈øpur on his Ambition, by lifting him up to a higher pitch than ever he a≈øpir'd to. Be≈øides, he comprehended the ≈øen≈øe of tho≈øe My≈øterious words, and
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:36383:50"/>the quality of Parricide which lay lurking underneath, ≈øtartled him; he was afraid of lo≈øing, in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced Age, that Glory which he had acquir'd in his Youth; and was unwilling to ≈øurvive him≈øelf, by ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering tho≈øe Lawrels to fade in <hi>France</hi> which he had gain'd in <hi>Pale≈øtine.</hi> He te≈øtified ≈øo great an aver≈øion for the General≈øhip, that they dur≈øt not men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it to him a ≈øecond time: And ≈øince the Memoirs which are extant of this great Per≈øonage make no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mention of him, it is to be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd he quitted the League, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately retir'd to his Ca≈øtle of <hi>Couci,</hi> there to ≈øpend the remnant of his days in a more innocent and quiet cour≈øe of Life.</p>
            <p>His refu≈øal augmented among the Rebels that Di≈øorder which his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance would have compos'd, and in fine, ≈øhatter'd them all to pieces. The Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> who had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øed to take the Field, kept his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:36383:50"/>in their Quarters in the Town which bears that name, and the Earl of <hi>Provence</hi> forbore to declare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf till ≈øuch time as he ≈øaw what Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy could be apply'd to the making up of the≈øe Breaches. His keeping off was no le≈øs happy than prudent; for as much as the Earl of <hi>Bologne</hi> being now convinc'd that the≈øe De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns formed again≈øt his Soveraign, could never ≈øucceed in the end, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ≈øo untoward a beginning, was the fir≈øt who quitted that Work whereof he him≈øelf had laid the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, and made an Accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion apart with the Regent: What the Conditions were, is not known, but ≈øure enough they were not very Advantageous, ≈øince on the one ≈øide his Apennage was not at all aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, and on the other ≈øide, the Regent had no Money to give him. A little after, the Earl of <hi>Dreux</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd to his Duty, obtaining onely the confirmation of the partage made
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:36383:51"/>with his Brother the Duke of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The falling off of ≈øo many Per≈øons of the fir≈øt Rank, one would think, had been enough to have broken the League, neverthele≈øs there were Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Gentlemen enough ≈øtill left to continue it, and the Regent knew well enough that there would be a Party of the Rebels ≈øtill on foot, ≈øo long as there might with ea≈øe be ≈øound a way to remove all pretext which ≈øhould hinder them of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat in <hi>Bretaign</hi> and the <hi>Low Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries,</hi> in ca≈øe they ≈øhould chance to be beaten in a Battel. It was a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult matcer to remove all at once two ≈øuch grand Refuges; and the Regent, after ≈øhe had along time exerci≈øed the utmo≈øt of her Wit and Cunning, effected as yet but half of what ≈øhe pretended to. The Duke of <hi>Bretaign</hi> remain'd ≈øtill inflexible, and Threats wrought now no more upon him than Promi≈øes had done
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:36383:51"/>before, ≈øo that the Regent as much exa≈øperated as wearied out with the Ob≈øtinacy of this Prince, turn'd more efficaciou≈øly her Policy another way.</p>
            <p>It was now about a dozen Years, that the Earls of <hi>Flanders</hi> and <hi>Damp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>martin</hi> had lyen langui≈øhing in Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon; and as the≈øe two Per≈øons were very near both Criminal alike, it ≈øeemed but ju≈øt that there ≈øhould be as little difference put in the Favour which was to be ≈øhewn them as there had been in their Guilt, and was in their Puni≈øhment. But their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were not equal; the Earl of <hi>Dampmartin</hi> was of a Humour ≈øo ill contriv'd, that it was not po≈ø≈øible to have any kind of Indulgence for him which he would not be apt to abu≈øe. The League wanted a Head, and that very thing was ≈øufficient to ob≈øtruct his Deliverance; for had he been let out, he had certainly gone immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and joyn'd the Rebels. The Earl of <hi>Flanders</hi> had more of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:36383:52"/>in him, and was not irregular in matters of Genero≈øity, except in ≈øuch Rencounters where he di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh'd it not ≈øufficiently from tho≈øe Vices which are de≈øign'd to pa≈øs for it; he had in his Soul a fund of good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, which facilitated his return to his Allegiance, however he had been carried away by Pa≈ø≈øion or Weakne≈øs. The Regent being inform'd of the ≈øtrong part and the weak of this <hi>Portuguez</hi> Prince, re≈øolv'd to give him that Liberty which ≈øhe deny'd the Earl of <hi>Dampmartin;</hi> and as ≈øhe never attracted ≈øo much Admiration as in matters of loud importance, ≈øo ≈øhe particularly accompanied this with ≈øo many Obliging Circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces for the Earl of <hi>Flanders,</hi> that he not onely remained firm him≈øelf to the Intere≈øts of his Benefactre≈øs, but al≈øo accepted of the Leave given him to return to his Wife, meerly upon this very account, that he might take her wholly off, as he did, from the
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:36383:52"/>League, and oblige her to call home tho≈øe Troops which ≈øhe had ≈øent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Rebels Camp.</p>
            <p>The Entreagues of Court were ≈øucceeded by the formalities of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtice; the Regent after ≈øhe had di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointed the League, ≈øummon'd the principal members to meet in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at <hi>Chinon,</hi> and afterwards at <hi>Tours.</hi> The Members ≈øummon'd appear'd neither at the fir≈øt, nor ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Citation, but when they were commanded to appear the third time at <hi>Vendome,</hi> and had but twenty days time allow'd them for their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; they con≈øulted among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves what they had be≈øt to do: The mo≈øt furious of them were of opinion, that they might leave the matter to be judg'd by <hi>Foreclu≈øion,</hi> and only bring it to a review when the war ≈øhould be ended; but the wi≈øer ≈øort were of a contrary judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, alledging that it was always a trouble≈øome thing to be ca≈øt in Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:36383:53"/>of what nature ≈øoever, and that an Arre≈øt could not po≈ø≈øibly come out again≈øt them without leaving a blot upon their memory; Hereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they concluded, that it would be nece≈ø≈øary to appear by Proxy, and if the Rea≈øons they brought for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of their Cau≈øe, were not ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to satisfie her, they would at lea≈øt ≈øerve to convince the People, that they were not ≈øo culpable as the Regent gave out; but neither the one, nor the other of the≈øe Councils were follow'd, and the re≈øolution they took was like the way of all ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious A≈ø≈øemblies in this, that they cho≈øe the very wor≈øt of all Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents propos'd. It was carryed by the plurality of voices, that the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and mo≈øt eminent Lords of the League, ≈øhould repair to <hi>Vendome,</hi> with a very ≈ømall Train, to per≈øwade the Regent that they had a ≈øincere de≈øire of a reconciliation with her, pre≈øuming, that the Regent deluded
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:36383:53"/>by this fair pretence, would not fail to bring along with her, or at lea≈øt ≈øend, the King her Son, to <hi>Vendome,</hi> with a ≈ømall guard, by rea≈øon that on the one ≈øide, the pre≈øence of this young Monarch would be ab≈øolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nece≈ø≈øary, on the other ≈øide, ≈øhe would be cautious of giving the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion of ≈øu≈øpicion to a People, who te≈øtified with ≈øo much frankne≈øs their readine≈øs to ≈øubmit to their Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, which would be obvious, in ca≈øe they ≈øhould ≈øee him attended with a greater number than was u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al upon ≈øuch like Ceremonies; that the Confederates who were Ma≈øters of <hi>E≈øtampes</hi> and <hi>Corbeil,</hi> might with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being percei'd draw out of tho≈øe two places, as many Forces as would be ≈øufficient to carry off the King; and that the Regent having lo≈øt him, by whom ≈øhe held her Authority, would be con≈øtrain'd to ≈øeek for an agreement with tho≈øe whom ≈øhe ≈øeem'd before ≈øo much to ≈ølight.</p>
            <pb n="98" facs="tcp:36383:54"/>
            <p>Who the Author was, of this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Council, is not certainly known; ≈øome Hi≈øtorians ≈øay it was the Duke of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> others, the Earl of <hi>March;</hi> but from who≈øe brain ≈øoever it proceeded, it was ≈øo exactly adju≈øted to the Conjuncture of Affairs at that time, that nothing but Divine Providence which took particular care of the pre≈øervation of St. <hi>Lewis,</hi> could have fru≈øtrated the de≈øign. The mo≈øt ≈øagacious wi≈ødom of this world hath its Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals, and ≈øometimes commits ≈øuch failings as folly it ≈øelf could not be guilty of greater. Seldom are long admini≈øtrations without ≈øome error, as if the government of States were a kind of Sea, where at one time or other there mu≈øt needs be Shipwrack. The Regent had hitherto follow'd the Maxims of mo≈øt exqui≈øite pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and her Enemies, who felt the ≈øharp Effects thereof, admir'd her no le≈øs than her friends, who had the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:36383:54"/>advantage of it, but all was ≈øpoil'd at one da≈øh; For whether it were that ≈øhe hop'd ≈øuddenly to conclude a Peace, or, that ≈øhe rely'd too much upon the judgments of her blind Coun≈øellors; ≈øhe ≈øent the King her Son to <hi>Vendome</hi> with a very weak guard.</p>
            <p>Never were there civil wars in <hi>France,</hi> but had this inconvenience attending, namely, that the de≈øigns of one party, though never ≈øo ≈øecretly carry'd, were in a moment known to the other; The Earl of <hi>Champaign</hi> had excellent Spies in the Army of the League, and never fail'd of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inform'd from time to time of whatever de≈øigns were form'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in regard the chief of tho≈øe who were mo≈øt privy thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, held corre≈øpondence with him, con≈øequently, he had immediately notice of all the particularities of the de≈øign laid for ≈øei≈øing the ≈øacred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the King. He advertis'd
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:36383:55"/>hereof the Regent who was then at <hi>Paris;</hi> for there the Council of State detain'd her, as ≈øuppo≈øing the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øence of this Prince≈øs would di≈øcover the corre≈øpondences of the Rebels in that great Town.</p>
            <p>The Regent was not ≈øo much troubled, though heartily angry at her ≈øelf, for her indi≈øcretion, at the error ≈øhe had committed, as in pain, till ≈øhe had found out a way to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy it, nor was it long e're her admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable inventive wit prompted her to a way which an≈øwer'd her de≈øires. She wrote to the King, who was in the <hi>Bourg de Cha≈øtres,</hi> to ≈øecure him≈øelf in the Ca≈øtle of <hi>Montleher,</hi> till ≈øuch time as ≈øhe could ≈øend Forces ≈øuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to deliver him, and in regard the Army Royal was at too great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtance, ≈øhe had recour≈øe to the Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen a≈ø≈øembled all the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonels, and other Officers from their re≈øpective Quarters, and in a mo≈øt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thetick
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:36383:55"/>thetick Speech repre≈øented to them the greatne≈øs of the danger the King was in, and the more effectually to move her audience, ≈øhe gave frequent interruptions to her Speech with tears and ≈øobs: and after ≈øhe had thus mollified their hearts, ≈øhe prick'd them on with the thoughts of what immortal glory would attend them in being the In≈øtruments of their Monarchs Pre≈øervation: Moreover, ≈øhe gave them to under≈øtand how little hazard they would run, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they made ha≈øte, ≈øince the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels who de≈øign'd to ≈øeize upon the King, at the pa≈ø≈øage of <hi>E≈øtampes,</hi> would fall into their mouths without going farther, the Colonels then ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a≈ø≈øur'd her that they would pre≈øently go, and get their Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies together, and ha≈øten their March, ≈øhe provided experienc'd under-Officers, to order and conduct them. The <hi>Parisians</hi> arriv'd at <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleher</hi> ≈øooner, and with greater
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:36383:56"/>force then could have been imagin'd; and having drawn up in a large Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion, they ≈øet the King in the mid≈øt of them, and brought him back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them to their Town, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Rebels had determin'd what mea≈øures were to be taken to oppo≈øe them: But by the ≈øame way that the Earl of <hi>Champaign</hi> came to know their de≈øign, they came to know that it was he who di≈øcover'd it to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent. However, the extraordinary de≈øire which they had to be reveng'd of him, did not yet ≈øo far blind them, but that they fore≈øaw it would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably more advantageous for them to make u≈øe of the natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con≈øtancy of this Prince, and to draw him once more over to their Party, than un≈øea≈øonably to endeavour his pre≈øent mi≈øchief. The Duke of <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taign,</hi> who had no Children but one Daughter, who≈øe beauty was charm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enough to rai≈øe the drooping Spirits of an ill treated Lover, had
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:36383:56"/>≈øhe not been endow'd be≈øides with a Province of large Extent, offer'd the Earl of <hi>Champaign,</hi> provided he would take part with the League, to put into his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion the Prince≈øs of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and to permit him either to e≈øpou≈øe her him≈øelf, or to bequeath her to ≈øome other Prince of his hou≈øe. This offer as advantageous as it was, the Earl refus'd, whether it were that he was not yet per≈øwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that the Regent con≈øider'd him no otherwi≈øe then as a property to be made u≈øe of, or, as hoping the two la≈øt Services he had render'd her, would produce at length the Effect which he had in vain expected, by all his former a≈ø≈øiduities once more; he made his Love tryumph over his Ambition, and all the fruit he drew from the≈øe Temptations, was to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verti≈øe the Regent thereof, to the end ≈øhe ≈øhould be ≈øen≈øible, that if he yielded not, ≈øhe was the ≈øole cau≈øe The Rebels more offended at his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:36383:57"/>than they had been at his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion, conceiv'd ≈øo implacable a malice again≈øt him, that they left the Regent to her quiet and repo≈øe, and re≈øolv'd to turn their Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt <hi>Champaign;</hi> they con≈øpire his ruine by a particular Treaty, and as they fore≈øaw that the Regent was too much oblig'd to abandon him to people whom he had not quitted but for her; they found a pretext ≈øo plau≈øible, that ≈øhe dur≈øt not appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, without commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a notorious piece of Inju≈øtice.</p>
            <p>Divine Providence had not ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly abandon'd the two Nieces of the Earl of <hi>Champaign,</hi> though de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauded of their Right, by their Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. The Elde≈øt nam'd <hi>Alice,</hi> had the fortune to be married to <hi>Hugo de Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignan,</hi> the fir≈øt of that Name, King of <hi>Cyprus;</hi> The goodne≈øs of <hi>Henry</hi> Father of this Prince≈øs, doubtle≈øs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd her this Match, and the Lord of <hi>Joinvile,</hi> the mo≈øt credible of all
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:36383:57"/>the Hi≈øtorians that write of St. <hi>Lew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>is,</hi> hath a pa≈ø≈øage concerning this matter, which it will not be from the purpo≈øe here to abbreviate: <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Earl of <hi>Champaign,</hi> the Elde≈øt Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and Predece≈ø≈øor of <hi>Thibault,</hi> was of ≈øo free and liberal a di≈øpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to give to all ≈øorts of People, e≈øpecially the poor, that he was thence ≈øirnam'd the <hi>Large,</hi> that is to ≈øay, large hearted, or bountiful. He had no particular Favourite, only there was one <hi>Artaud</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Troyes,</hi> who had in≈øinuated into his familiarity, whether it were, that there was ≈øome conformity in their humours, or, that the Earl had the more con≈øideration, for <hi>Artaud,</hi> in regard he was the riche≈øt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. One day when they were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether at Church, a poor Gentleman pre≈øented his two daughters to the Earl, and be≈øought him to be≈øtow ≈øomething upon them to marry them off. They were hand≈øome, and of
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:36383:58"/>an Age ≈øo fully ripe for Marriage, that in ca≈øe they ≈øtay'd much longer unprovided for, it was to be fear'd their virtue might be in danger. <hi>Artaud</hi> knew well enough that the Prince his Exchequer was much ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hau≈øted, and brought low; and as he had many times taken upon him to an≈øwer for the ≈øaid Earl, without being thought ill of for his pains, ≈øo upon this occa≈øion he ≈ømartly told the Gentleman, that the Earls Libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality had already brought him ≈øo low, that he had hardly any thing left to give.</p>
            <p>There is nothing ≈øo ungrateful to the quality of a Prince as Poverty, and therefore nothing ≈øo ill to be brook'd by them as the reproach thereof; The Earl now incens'd at the too much liberty, or, to ≈øay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ≈øaucine≈øs of <hi>Artaud,</hi> told him he lyed, and that he had yet enough to give, if it were but an <hi>Artaud;</hi> and at the in≈øtant of his pronouncing the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:36383:58"/>word <hi>Artaud,</hi> he made ≈øigns to the Gentleman to ≈øei≈øe upon the Citizen, and to demand what Ran≈øome for him he pleas'd. The Gentleman ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly took hold of him, carryed him away to Pri≈øon, and there de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd him till he had paid 500 Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres, which ≈øerv'd for Portions for the two Dam≈øels.</p>
            <p>The Rebels took hold of Count <hi>Henry</hi>'s Liberality, to concern them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves in his behalf to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, maintaining, that it was a thing not to be endur'd, to ≈øee the Elde≈øt Daughter of him who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ≈øo many poor People kept out from her hereditary E≈øtate; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly offer'd their a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward her ree≈øtabli≈øhment. The Queen of <hi>Cyprus</hi> took them at their word, and the <hi>Champaigne≈øes</hi> ≈øeing them enter their Countrie with two Armies, one commanded by the Duke of <hi>Bourgogne,</hi> the other by <hi>Hugo de Lu≈øignan,</hi> Earl of <hi>March,</hi>

The Rebels ≈øucce≈øs gave them oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to take new mea≈øures, they abandon'd all the pretence they had formerly made u≈øe of again≈øt the Regent, and declar'd them≈øelves her Maje≈øties mo≈øt humble Servants, they prote≈øted they had taken Arms on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to re≈øtore the Queen of <hi>Cyprus</hi> to that E≈øtate ≈øhe layd claim to, they offer'd to lay down their Arms, as ≈øoon as their mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Maje≈øties ≈øhould have beheld with ≈øatisfaction and approbation the ree≈øtabli≈øhment of this Prince≈øs, and to decide the difference between her and her Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by a fair combate, pre≈øuming, there were no le≈øs than 300 Knights, as well on the one ≈øide, as the other. Their Maje≈øties accepted the ≈øubmi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of the Rebels with this re≈øerve, that they were to have the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign deci≈øion of the affair in hand,
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:36383:59"/>after they had try'd all ways which their prudence ≈øhould ≈øugge≈øt to them, to bring the Parties to agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but that above all things it was expected his mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Maje≈øty ≈øhould be inve≈øted with the Right of Seque≈øtration, that is, ≈øhould have the Title of all the E≈øtates in Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øie depo≈øited in his Royal hands.</p>
            <p>The Rebels who found that this Expedient would not turn to any account to them, rejected it, and the Regent ≈øent Forces enough into <hi>Champaign,</hi> to di≈ølodge the Earls Enemies. She fore≈øaw in the end, that in pronouncing a definitive Sentence upon ≈øo nice a Proce≈øs, her Authority and Reputation would be much expos'd and brought into dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; for that if her Sentence were favourable to the Earl of <hi>Champaign,</hi> all the <hi>French</hi> would be ready to tax he of notorious Inju≈øtice, e≈øpecially if ≈øhe ≈øhould make it her bu≈øine≈øs in this affair, to ≈øerve her pretended Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:36383:60"/>all the Satyrical wits would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to let fly at her, with more fury than before: on the other ≈øide, if ≈øhe ≈øhould decree the Queens ree≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øhment in her E≈øtate, of the hou≈øe of <hi>Champaign,</hi> ≈øhe would be liable to be cen≈øur'd of Ingratitude toward Count <hi>Thibault,</hi> to whom ≈øhe ow'd her Regency at lea≈øt, if not her Life. In ≈øhort, which way ≈øoever ≈øhe gave her Sentence, all outward appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances conduce to this per≈øwa≈øion, that the Arre≈øt would be ≈øubject to a review, becau≈øe otherwi≈øe the Duke of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and the re≈øt of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted Peers, would not have been a≈ø≈øi≈øtant in it; ≈øo that the bu≈øine≈øs could not but go well on the fair one's ≈øide: and this the Regent brought the better about by a trick, which in brief was as followeth. She repre≈øented to the Queen of <hi>Cyprus,</hi> that the Rebels ≈øending for her, was but to make her endure a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of affliction, after a ≈øhort
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36383:60"/>fla≈øh of joy, for that no ≈øooner ≈øhould ≈øhe be put into the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of her Fathers E≈øtate by their means, but ≈øhe would be driven out again, and that ≈øhe plainly fore≈øaw the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels would not be in a capacity of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtoring her the ≈øecond time; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øince her engaging with them would ≈øignifie ≈øo little to her, there remain'd but one Expedient by which if ≈øhe would take her advice, ≈øhe might come off with honour. That ≈øhe had but one Son, who in regard he was oblig'd to re≈øide in <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prus,</hi> would not be able to pre≈øerve the Inheritance of <hi>Champaign</hi> any long time, though ≈øhe her ≈øelf ≈øhould leave the peaceable po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it to him: that her daughters would never find Matches in <hi>Cyprus</hi> an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to their quality, that therefore it would be much better for her by yielding to an accomodation with Count <hi>Thibault,</hi> to receive a pre≈øent ≈øumm of mony, and ≈øuch a portion
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36383:61"/>of Land in <hi>France,</hi> as would put her into a capacity of matching her daughters into Sovereign hou≈øes, than by ≈øtanding out to be reduc'd to a Condition of having nothing to give them.</p>
            <p>The Queen of <hi>Cyprus</hi> was not without tho≈øe failings which are u≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al with per≈øons of little or no experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the World; ≈øhe de≈øpair'd of ever bringing to pa≈øs tho≈øe affairs, in which ≈øhe was bauk'd at fir≈øt, and had too much impatience in the mid≈øt of ill fortune, to wait the turning of the Tide.

<pb n="113" facs="tcp:36383:61"/>of ready mony, and the Counties of <hi>Brienne</hi> and <hi>Joigni,</hi> for all ≈øhe pretended to of her Fathers and Mothers E≈øtates.</p>
            <p>Earl <hi>Thibault</hi> was not ≈øo indi≈øcreet to refu≈øe an agreement which was of ≈øuch advantage to him, but he want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed money, and the ≈øumm he was to rai≈øe was ≈øo con≈øiderable, that his Subjects harra≈øs'd by the quartering of ≈øo great Forces as had lately been among them, were not able to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øh him, and no le≈øs unable to a≈ø≈øi≈øt him, were the re≈øt of the Feudata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries his friends; ≈øo that if it were any where to be had, it mu≈øt be had out of the Kings Exchequer; but the Regent was too prudent to take any thing out from thence, but upon ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Terms, and what ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligations ≈øhe and the King, her Son, had to the Earl, when all things came to be weigh'd in the ballance of Truth, it would ea≈øily appear that he had done them as much harm as
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:36383:62"/>good, having poi≈øon'd the Father of the one, and the Husband of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. His power too great for any Va≈ø≈øal, gave him the boldne≈øs to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this crime, and the only way to be reveng'd on him for it, was to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to ≈øuch a Condition, that his Succe≈ø≈øours ≈øhould never dare to have any thoughts of the like at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, as not being able to execute them with Impunity. In ≈øhort, the de≈øign in hand was to weaken the hou≈øe of <hi>Champaign,</hi> and this pre≈øent occa≈øion was too favourable to be neglected. The Regent waited the time when this Summ ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øir'd of her, and when the bu≈øine≈øs was mov'd, ≈øhe made an≈øwer ≈øhe was ready to lend, provided ≈øuch Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were given for the repayment thereof, as was fit to be accepted by a King's Mother, and Governe≈øs. The Earl offer'd her Maje≈øty to engage tho≈øe Counties he po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd in the heart of the Kingdom; but it was
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:36383:62"/>an≈øwer'd him, that this kind of En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement would be ≈øubject to grand Inconveniences and hazards, both as to the repaiment of Principal and Intere≈øt; and the care which was to be had to repair wa≈øtes, and make Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements; that it became a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verne≈øs to avoid as much as po≈ø≈øibly ≈øhe could, all kind of Embara≈øments in the affairs of her Pupil: In fine, if the Earl had a mind to ≈øell, ≈øhe was willing rather to purcha≈øe than to lend mony. The Earl ≈øaw well enough that they went about to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine him, in ≈øo ≈øubtile a manner, as that he ≈øhould have no certain foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation or pretence of complaint; he was a man of too much ≈øen≈øe and ≈øpirit, not to be troubled to ≈øee him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf thus dealt with, and to find by the≈øe proceedings, that the Regent was far from ever having any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for him: but it was no time now to declare his re≈øentment, and he fore≈øaw that in ca≈øe he refus'd to
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:36383:63"/>relinqui≈øh a part of his Inheritance, he ≈øhould be ≈øure to lo≈øe all; Upon which he con≈øented to ≈øell the King, his Earldoms of <hi>Charters, Blois,</hi> and <hi>Sancerre,</hi> and the Vi≈øcount≈øhip of <hi>Chateaudun;</hi> and out of the money of this ≈øale, Her Maje≈øty deducted 40000 Livres which ≈øhe paid immediately to the Queen of <hi>Cyprus,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Rebels by this Tran≈øaction being fru≈øtrated of the pretence, they had of treating the Earl as an Enemy, and on the other ≈øide, not being able ea≈øily to re≈øolve upon forgiving him, found out another Expedient, which was no le≈øs advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to their Party. They laid Trea≈øon to his Charge, impeaching him of the untimely death of his late Sovereign Lord King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th. by poy≈øon given him, and offer'd to undergo the ≈øevere≈øt penalties that could be inflicted upon fal≈øe accu≈øers, if they did not plainly prove him guilty of two Crimes, which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:36383:63"/>him unfit for humane Society, that is to ≈øay, of high Trea≈øon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his Sovereign Lord, and of being a Traitor again≈øt his Country. This they urg'd with Arms in their hands, and the danger which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Crown, from their impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heat, was thought ≈øo con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that all the grand Mini≈øters of the Kings Council were of Opinion, that the be≈øt way would be to give, them ≈øome ≈øatisfaction. The Count him≈øelf was of the ≈øame Sentiment for quietne≈øs ≈øake, and it was with his own con≈øent, that the Queen up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Treaty with them, made the chief Condition of their laying down their Arms, to be the Earl of <hi>Champaign</hi>'s taking upon him the <hi>Croi≈øada,</hi> and ≈øetting out immediately for the holy Land, attended with a hundred Knights at lea≈øt, to be maintain'd at his own Charge.</p>
            <p>This was a very notable Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, in regard it equally pleas'd both
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:36383:64"/>Parties; For on the one ≈øide, the Earl found it very advantageous to him, in regard, both his Crime met with a far gentler puni≈øhment than it really de≈øerv'd, or he could have hop'd for, had he been brought to Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; and his Reputation was in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ≈øalv'd, by going in a croud of ≈øo many innocent per≈øons, as daily went upon this Expedition, upon no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther motive than their mo≈øt ardent zeal. On the other ≈øide, the Rebels al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øo obtain'd what they de≈øir'd; for, be≈øides that they had a long time of deliverance from their Enemy, and the ≈øatisfaction of having put him upon an Expedition, from whence few valiant men live to return; If the accu≈øation wherewith they branded him were not made out in full, it was at lea≈øt in part, for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting, there were among the <hi>Croi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øado'd</hi> Champions many innocent per≈øons, there were al≈øo many cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable; and as divers Princes and
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:36383:64"/>Great men led Armies over into <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øtine,</hi> merely for the accompli≈øhing of tho≈øe religious vows they had made for the recovery of the holy places, where Je≈øus Chri≈øt had been conver≈øant, and died for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankind; So there were o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, of no le≈øs grandure, who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook this Voyage, or rather Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, as a penance enjoyn'd, and to obtain ab≈øolution of tho≈øe Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øia≈øtical Cen≈øures, which they lay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. And this was the ca≈øe of <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øecond, King of <hi>England,</hi> who, for his A≈ø≈øa≈ø≈øination of St. <hi>Thomas</hi> of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> had this penitential Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age enjoyn'd him by Pope <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> the third, which our Earl of <hi>Champaign</hi> ≈øo willingly accepts.</p>
            <p>Civil wars and the Defluctions of the body end much after the ≈øame manner, that is to ≈øay, by di≈øcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them≈øelves all at once upon the weake≈øt part, and throwing on it a greater weight than it is able to bear.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:36383:65"/>The <hi>French</hi> were almo≈øt brought to a right under≈øtanding, yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs would not ea≈øily con≈øent to lay down their Arms; they earne≈øtly pre≈øs'd to be employ'd in pro≈øecuting the de≈øign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th. and there was rea≈øon to fear, le≈øt the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øal of their demand might occa≈øion new troubles.

In order hereunto, the Regent re≈øolv'd to drive the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> to the utmo≈øt extremity; and the better to a≈ø≈øure her ≈øelf of the greate≈øt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage po≈ø≈øible in all humane appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, ≈øhe made it her fir≈øt bu≈øine≈øs to deprive this Prince, who≈øe ruine ≈øhe de≈øign'd, of the ≈øure≈øt refuge he had to tru≈øt to.</p>
            <p>It hath been already ob≈øerv'd that
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:36383:65"/>the Earl of <hi>Provence</hi> was his Cou≈øin, and a Prince in like manner as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, of the hou≈øe of <hi>Catalogue. Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> had expectation of a≈ø≈øi≈øtance more ways than one. Tho≈øe of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vence</hi> were in a Condition to aid them, if not directly, yet at lea≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly, being at that time the mo≈øt free from war of any people in <hi>France,</hi> and their Prince the mo≈øt mony'd man of any Prince in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> Mony was the main thing the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> wanted, and but for the want of which he could not have wanted Souldiers, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all the Excommunications thunder'd again≈øt him from the Court of <hi>Rome.</hi> Above all things therefore the Earl of <hi>Provence</hi> mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be taken off; him the Regent knew to be a ≈øincere man and a mo≈øt punctual ob≈øerver of his word; wherefore ≈øhe repre≈øented to him, by ≈øecret Me≈ø≈øengers, that he was now grown old, and could not, if
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:36383:66"/>he regarded his health, and con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd his true Intere≈øt, engage him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf in the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> his quarrel, without drawing an inevitable war upon <hi>Provence,</hi> let him u≈øe all the faution he could. That he had only our daughters, and the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> but one, ≈øo that ≈øince the hou≈øe of <hi>Catalonia</hi> was drawing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward a period, he could not better con≈øult for the honour and advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Family, than by making an Alliance with that of <hi>France,</hi> which beyond all di≈øpute, was the noble≈øt in the world. That the Elde≈øt of the <hi>Provencian</hi> Prince≈ø≈øes could not be more happily matcht than with the young King of <hi>France;</hi> that this propo≈øal was not ≈øo much upon the account of her E≈øtate, as of her matchle≈øs beauty, and the charming ≈øweetne≈øs of her Nature; and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince to the Earl that this Alliance was not in the lea≈øt promoted, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the uniting of his E≈øtate
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:36383:66"/>to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> there ≈øhould be a renunciation made to any ≈øuch preten≈øion upon the contract of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of the King, with his Elde≈øt daughter, and free leave given him to divide all he had among his three younger daughters, or to give it to her of the three, whom he preferr'd before the re≈øt. The Earl of <hi>Provence</hi> could never have been more ea≈øily tempted than by two ≈øuch ≈øoft and obliging Proportions, as the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding his Life in Tranquility, and repo≈øe, and the liberty to di≈øpo≈øe his E≈øtate as he pleas'd; For be≈øides that, he was much of the temper of tho≈øe effeminate Princes, who hate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than bu≈øine≈øs: he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertaken with the vice of tho≈øe who happen to have Children in their old Age, that is to ≈øay, he lov'd the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øs <hi>Beatrice</hi> his younge≈øt daughter better than any of the other three, to her he de≈øign'd to leave <hi>Provence,</hi> and as a man is apt for the mo≈øt part
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:36383:67"/>to give way to the belief of what he earne≈øtly and con≈øtantly de≈øires, he per≈øwaded him≈øelf that in preferring the younge≈øt, he ≈øhould do no wrong to the three Elder daughters, ≈øince it was his intention to leave them his Trea≈øures which he look'd upon as treble the value of his Sovereignty.</p>
            <p>He fancy'd, if the King of <hi>France</hi> by marrying of his Elde≈øt daughter, ≈øhewd him≈øelf an approver of what he had determin'd, who ever ≈øhould have the two next in Marriage, would not dare to gain≈øay it; and he had ≈øo great confidence in the Regents word, that he doubted not in the lea≈øt of her promi≈øe, however, ≈øhe deferr'd the Nuptials for ≈øome years by rea≈øon of the minority of the young Couple. All the≈øe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiderations di≈øpos'd him ≈øo perfectly to a Compliance, that he beheld the ruine of the Count of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> with as much in≈øen≈øibility, as if he had been neither his Relation, nor his
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:36383:67"/>Neighbour. In fine, the Regent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well a≈ø≈øur'd that the <hi>Albigen≈øes</hi> could not receive any ≈øuccours from <hi>Provence,</hi> and out of fear of any ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to come to them from <hi>Spain,</hi> in regard the <hi>Aragonians</hi> and <hi>Ca≈øtilians</hi> were at wars together, ≈øent the <hi>French</hi> Army into <hi>Languedoc</hi> under the Command of <hi>Imbert de Beaujeu,</hi> Con≈øtable of <hi>France,</hi> a Captain, whom <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Montfort</hi> fir≈øt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanc'd in the war.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> did not all this while lye ≈øtil; but whether it were that he perceiv'd the League would not la≈øt long, or, whether he grew ≈øen≈øible of the error he had committed in not taking advantage of the perplexity the Regent had been envolv'd in, to recover entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly what he had lo≈øt, he made ha≈øte to take the Field, and laid Siege to the Town of <hi>Ca≈øtel Sara≈øin,</hi> the ≈øtronge≈øt next <hi>Avignon,</hi> of all that the <hi>French</hi> held in <hi>Languedoc;</hi> he
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:36383:68"/>found it well Garri≈øon'd, and a place of too great ≈øtrength, what ever he had fancy'd, for him ea≈øily to take, which was the principal cau≈øe of his utter ruine, ≈øince the unprofitable attempts he made to take it by Force co≈øt him all his be≈øt Souldiers: and thinking it derogatory to his honour not to take it by Storm, he lo≈øt ≈øo much time in making his approaches and Batteries, that when at la≈øt he was driven to accept of it by Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render, the be≈øieged were ≈øcarce got out before the <hi>French</hi> Army return'd into <hi>Languedoc.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was no le≈øs powerful than that which had been there before, under the Command of King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th; for be≈øides that, ≈øcarce any one of the Feudataries was wanting, the Clergy re≈øolving to pluck up Root and Branch, all that was remaining of Here≈øie in the Kingdom, thought it not enough to ≈øend tho≈øe Souldiers which they were oblig'd to ≈øet out

<pb n="130" facs="tcp:36383:70"/>Thus not coming to a clear ≈øen≈øe of their misfortune, till at a time when it was too late to avoid the danger, they fancy'd it greater than really it was, and their di≈øturb'd Imagination caus'd them in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to lo≈øe that re≈øpect which till then they had pre≈øerv'd for their So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign, as Criminal and unfortunate as he was.</p>
            <p>They form'd a Con≈øpiracy, ≈øo much the more dangerous, by how much the better it was regulated.

She was yet ≈øcarce di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engaged from a civil war rais'd prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally again≈øt her Authority; and ≈øhe was too di≈øcreet to imagine, that the readie≈øt way to oblige the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of the Rebels to lay down their Arms, would be to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the affair of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> the greate≈øt affair that had been known
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:36383:72"/>in <hi>France,</hi> ≈øince the third Race, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the advice of the Barons of the Realm. It was therefore thought fit to invite the Barons to a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with the Deputies of <hi>Tholou≈øe;</hi> and the Town of <hi>Meaux</hi> was made choice of for the place of A≈ø≈øembly, not only as being mo≈øt commodious for the Feudataries, who≈øe Re≈øidences were almo≈øt equally di≈øtant from it, but al≈øo in re≈øpect of its nearne≈øs to <hi>Paris,</hi> by which means the place would be the more ea≈øily ≈øupplied with ≈øuch a quantity of Provi≈øions as would be nece≈ø≈øary for ≈øuch an A≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øembly, and ≈øo great a Concour≈øe of People.</p>
            <p>The plea≈øant Sea≈øon of the Year <hi>viz.</hi> 1228. made the Re≈øort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple the greater; and ≈øuch as for their pa≈øt faults fear'd the Courts di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure, obtain'd of the Regent all ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary a≈ø≈øurances both as to their coming, their ≈øtay, and their return; but it was no very ea≈øy matter to
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:36383:72"/>quiet their minds as for the time to come, and the Regent her ≈øelf went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout in vain to ≈øatisfie them by ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary means. They went, or to ≈øay bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ran to the War of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> with a Tran≈øport of Zeal, which gave them not time to make ≈øuch Reflections as concern'd their own proper Conduct, till after ≈øuch time as Here≈øie was almo≈øt ≈øubdued. They had con≈øider'd the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> as an Enemy to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> ≈øo long as they had their Swords in their hands; but from that very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that they laid down their Arms, their Aver≈øion ≈øo totally ceas'd, that pa≈øs'd all at once, and without any <hi>Medium</hi> from the extremity of Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, to extremity of pity. It was no extraordinary thing to them to ≈øee Rebel Va≈ø≈øals ruin'd, and the Reign of <hi>Philip</hi> the <hi>Augu≈øt</hi> had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ≈øufficient Examples thereof. There was not any of tho≈øe who≈øe E≈øtates they had ≈øeen confi≈øcated, ≈øo culpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:36383:73"/>as the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> ≈øince be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides the Crime of high Trea≈øon, both as to God and man, which he had more than once committed: he was, if not the Author of a very dangerous Here≈øie, yet, at lea≈øt, the entertainer of it from the fir≈øt broachers, and the cheri≈øher of it, as I may ≈øo ≈øay, in his bo≈øome: he thought it not enough to hinder Royal Ju≈øtice from ≈øei≈øing on the Per≈øons, and enquiring into the Crimes of tho≈øe who taught it in his Province; but he him≈øelf became a Preacher thereof, contrary to the Genius of the <hi>French</hi> Nobility, who had at that time an Antipathy both for the Doctrine, and tho≈øe who were engag'd in it. He alone had per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted more Catholicks than all the re≈øt of the <hi>Albigen≈øes,</hi> and to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the mea≈øure both of his obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate pravity of Nature, and of the misfortune that attended it, he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laps'd into the ≈øame Here≈øie he had
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:36383:73"/>con≈øented to abjure; which alone was enough to render the Court of <hi>Rome</hi> irreconcilable to him.</p>
            <p>There was now no place left for Excu≈øe or Complaint, and there were ≈øuch Circum≈øtances in his Degradati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as have ≈øcarce been known in the Ca≈øe of any other Criminal. He fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viv'd a War which had been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken chiefly for his cha≈øti≈øement; he ≈øubmitted him≈øelf before he was driven to the la≈øt Extremity: he came to Terms in a Town, wherein he might have held out a longer time by much: he pretended to no hopes of Favour, but in the Clemency of their Maje≈øties.</p>
            <p>The Indulgences formerly us'd by the mo≈øt Chri≈øtian Kings, to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of <hi>France,</hi> bred up in the ≈øame Principles, were now no le≈øs favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly apply'd to the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe;</hi> for never were Fiefs ≈øeen to change their Family; and the Relations, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the De≈øcendants of Criminals,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:36383:74"/>had alwayes the Forfeitures of the E≈øtates remitted to them, provided on the one ≈øide, they were never par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers with them in their Crimes, and on the other ≈øide, were capable of the Homage requir'd. All this while the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe,</hi> his Fief, was by the Female ≈øide; for it was well known that a Woman brought it into the hou≈øe of <hi>Catalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</hi> The ≈øaid Earl had only one daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who being but nine Years of Age, could not po≈ø≈øibly be charg'd with the lea≈øt concernment in any of her Fathers Crimes. <hi>Languedoc</hi> had been po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd by his Ance≈øtors for 22 Generations, and it would have been thought hard for the mi≈ødemea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of the pre≈øent po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor to ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine a Family, wherein 21 Per≈øons ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øively have been free from all Tainture. In fine, if it were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous in one ≈øen≈øe, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent to augment her Authority, by reuniting to the Kings demeans the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:36383:74"/>E≈øtate of one of the mo≈øt con≈øidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Peers of <hi>France,</hi> it would be dangerous in another ≈øen≈øe, ≈øince up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ≈øuch an attempt as this, all the re≈øt of the Feudataries of the ≈øaid Crown, as well in general, as in particular, would be concern'd to hinder it, for fear this one Spark kindled ≈øhould rai≈øe a Flame great enough to catch hold of each of them in their turn, and give them ≈øuch occa≈øions of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content, as mu≈øt needs incite them to a Revolt; ≈øo that in the end the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of their puni≈øhment, would be an inevitable occa≈øion of empairing that Grandure, which at pre≈øent gave lu≈øtre to the Crown.</p>
            <p>The <hi>French</hi> came off hand≈øomly enough, in the declaring of what they had in their mind, and the Regent who had heard them more than once; found a way to ≈øatisfie them without neglecting in the main, the Intere≈øts of her Son. She agreed with the Earl of <hi>Tholou≈øe</hi> his Deputies
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:36383:75"/>upon Conditions more advantage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than he could have hop'd for: ≈øhe con≈øented that their Prince ≈øhould be ree≈øtabli≈øh'd in the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> upon Condition, only the Fortifications ≈øhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moli≈øh'd: ≈øhe permitted him the qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this large Province as long as he liv'd, and let him know withal, that ≈øhe de≈øign'd nothing le≈øs than to keep the Prince≈øs his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter out of her hereditary po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: on the contrary, ≈øhe would take care to pre≈øerve it entire to her Po≈øterity. It was her opinion the Prince≈øs could not be better provided for, than by being e≈øpous'd to <hi>Alphon≈øo</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> Earl of <hi>Poitou,</hi> being of the ≈øame Age with her, neither did ≈øhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand any other Security for the Earls performance of his word, but that the Prince≈øs ≈øhould be brought up at Court. She in≈øi≈øted indeed, to have the Articles of Marriage in≈øert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Treaty of peace, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:36383:75"/>hand≈øomly took occa≈øion to have this one Article ≈ølip'd in, <hi>viz.</hi> that in Ca≈øe both the young married Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons ≈øhould dye without I≈ø≈øue, <hi>Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guedoc</hi> ≈øhould be again united to the Crown of <hi>France,</hi> as indeed it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Her pretence for this Article was, that no per≈øon might receive a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny prejudice, ≈øince St. <hi>Lewis</hi> was to e≈øpou≈øe the Elde≈øt Daughter of the Earl of <hi>Provence,</hi> pre≈øumptive Heire≈øs of the Prince≈øs of <hi>Tholou≈øe;</hi> and in Truth, ≈øhe in ≈øuch fort con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed this great Affair, which gave jealou≈øie to all the world, that no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy could find any cau≈øe to murmur at it.</p>
            <p>The Earl of <hi>March</hi> by this means was gain'd, and his only daughter contracted to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the King's younge≈øt Brother.</p>
            <p>Thus the Earl of <hi>Bretaign</hi> was left alone in the League, who≈øe ob≈øtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy was, that he cho≈øe rather to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd the ≈øole Mark of all the
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:36383:76"/>
               <hi>French</hi> Forces now united together, than to accept of tho≈øe advantageous Conditions offer'd him by the Queen. The very Civilities ≈øhe ≈øhew'd him at a juncture of time when all things ≈øeem'd to con≈øpire his ruine, exa≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated the ≈øpirit of this Capricious Per≈øon; and becau≈øe the Con≈øciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of his own guilt repre≈øented to him all kindne≈ø≈øes and good Offices done him as Counterfeit, he con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently fancy'd what the Regent did to oblige him, to be but meer For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and done only to draw him into a farther ≈ønare; and upon this fal≈øe pre≈øumption, he in≈øtantly went and treated with <hi>England.</hi> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent was ≈øoon advertis'd hereof, and re≈øolv'd to lo≈øe no time in driving on the bu≈øine≈øs to a Head, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter began to come on very ≈øharp, and the time was overpa≈øt for ≈øetting out the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Fleet to Sea, for the relief of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> which was now brought to do Homage to the King
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:36383:76"/>of <hi>England,</hi> the <hi>French</hi> encouraged by the pre≈øence of their mo≈øt Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtian Maje≈øties, went directly, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a ≈øhort Siege took the Town of <hi>Angers,</hi> which King <hi>Lewis</hi> the 8th, having taken from the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> had put into the hands of the <hi>Bretons.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Queen had no ≈øooner di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd what ≈øhe went about in <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jou,</hi> but with the ≈øame Expedition and Diligence as ≈øhe had march'd thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ≈øhe return'd and laid clo≈øe Siege to <hi>Bele≈øme,</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Perch,</hi> and the ≈øtronge≈øt place the Enemy then had. It was thought impregna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but the Rams and other Engines of Battery having at la≈øt thrown down the Walls, made it appear to be otherwi≈øe. The be≈øieged came to Capitulation, but not till ≈øuch time as the Be≈øiegers were almo≈øt tir'd with continual labour, for they had as hard a task to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves from the rigours of the Sea≈øon, as from the Arms of the be≈øieged.
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:36383:77"/>the extremity of Cold cau≈øing ≈øuch a Paralytick Di≈øtemper among them, that tho≈øe affected therewith, could hardly e≈øcape death, the only way was, to ≈øit basking continually by a good fire ≈øide. Thus, through one, or other ob≈øtacle, their Maje≈øties found it a difficult matter to march their Army into <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was the main Rea≈øon, why they ≈øought out another Expedient for the putting an end to the War.</p>
            <p>The Regent ≈øent to the Nobility of <hi>Bretaign,</hi> and repre≈øented to them, that their Lands would cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly be laid wa≈øte, if they did not immediately put them≈øelves under the Kings Protection, that the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ≈øhe warn'd them of, was very near at hand, and that their Duke would not be able to help them: then ≈øhe made her Addre≈øs to the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>France,</hi> and requir'd to have <hi>Bretaign</hi> put into the King's hands, the Parliament yielded to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:36383:77"/>and acquitted this Province of their Homage to their Duke, who thereupon, was depriv'd of the principal Refuge he had to tru≈øt to, and his Troops now no longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting of ≈øuch Gentlemen, as held of him by any Tenure of Land, drop'd away by degrees, and were all di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierc'd in a ≈øhort time; He was dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in fine to this <hi>Dilemma,</hi> either to keep him≈øelf ≈øhut up in ≈øome ≈øtrong Town, or, to pa≈øs over into <hi>England:</hi> the fir≈øt of the≈øe two extreams would infallibly bereave him of his Liberty, if not of Life al≈øo: the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, by forcing him to quit his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, would reduce him to a private Condition. Tho≈øe who by chance or accidentarrive to Sovereignty, more grievou≈øly re≈øent a fall, than tho≈øe whom a natural Title, and the Laws have inve≈øted with a power of Reigning. Thus ≈øtreightned and perplex'd, he re≈øolv'd at a Venture to ≈øubmit to whatever the Regent
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:36383:78"/>would impo≈øe upon him; and in Conclu≈øion, came off with the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendry of the Lands, which the hou≈øe of <hi>Bretaign</hi> po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd in <hi>France,</hi> be≈øides, the Dutchy; and giving in Security both for him≈øelf, and his Heirs, that the ≈øaid Dutchy ≈øhould from that time forward, never hold of any but the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The firname of <hi>Mauclerk</hi> ≈øtuck up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him to future Ages, for having ≈øo ill taken his mea≈øures with the <hi>French</hi> Rebels, and with the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> that in the end he was left alone to bear the whole bront of the Controver≈øie. And now Queen <hi>Blanch</hi> had no more to trouble, or, ob≈øtruct the quiet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration of Her Regency, but through the vain Attempts of tho≈øe that labour'd to oppo≈øe Her, was ≈øo much the more ≈øtrongly fix'd and e≈øtabli≈øh'd therein.</p>
